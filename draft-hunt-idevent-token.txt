Abstract

   This specification defines the Security Event token, which may be
   distributed via a protocol such as HTTP.  The Security Event Token
   (SET) specification profiles the JSON Web Token (JWT) and may be
   optionally signed and/or encrypted.  A SET describes a statement of
   fact that may be shared by an event publisher with event subscribers.

1.  Introduction and Overview

   This specification defines an extensible Security Event Token (SET)
   format which may be exchanged using protocols such as HTTP.  The
   specification builds on the JSON Web Token (JWT) format [RFC7519] in
   order to provide a self-contained token that can be optionally signed
   using JSON Web Signature (JWS) [RFC7515] and/or encrypted using JSON
   Web Encryption (JWE) [RFC7516].

   For the purpose of this specification, an event is a statement of
   fact by a publisher (also known as the event issuer) that the state
   of a security subject (e.g., a web resource, token, IP address) it
   controls or is aware of, has changed in some way (explicitly or
   implicitly).  A security subject may be permanent (e.g., a user
   account) or temporary (e.g., a login session) in nature.  A state
   change may include direct changes of entity state, implicit changes
   to state or other higher-level security statements such as:

   o  The creation, modification, removal of a resource.

   o  The resetting or suspension of an account.

   o  The revocation of a security token prior to its expiry.

   o  The logout of a user session.  Or,

   o  A cumulative conclusion such as to indicate that a user has taken
      over an email identifier that may have been used in the past by
      another user.

   Based on some agreed upon criteria for an event Feed, the publisher
   distributes events to the appropriate subscribers.  While an event
   may be delivered via synchronous means (e.g., HTTP POST), the
   distribution of the event often happens asynchronously to the change
   of state which generated the security event.  As an example, an
   OAuth2 Authorization Server [RFC6749], having received a token
   revocation request [RFC7009], may issue a token revocation event to
   downstream web resource providers.  Having been informed of a token
   revocation, the OAuth2 web resource service provider may add the
   token identifier to its local revocation list assuming the token has
   not already expired.

   A subscriber having received an event, validates and interprets the
   event and takes its own independent action, if any.  For example,
   having been informed of a personal identifier now being associated
   with a different security subject (i.e., is being used by someone
   else), the subscriber may choose to ensure that the new user is not
   granted access to resources associated with the previous user.  Or it
   may not have any relationship with the subject, and no action is
   taken.

   While subscribers will often take actions upon receiving one or more
   events, events MUST NOT be assumed to be commands or requests.  To do
   so requires complex bi-directional signals and error recovery
   mechanisms that fall outside the scope of this specification.  The
   intent of this specification is to define a way of exchanging
   statements of fact that subscribers may interpret for their own
   purposes.  Since events are typically historical statements by a
   publisher and are not commands, idempotency or lack thereof, does not
   apply.

   Unless otherwise specified, this specification uses example events
   intended as non-normative examples showing how an event may be used.
   It is expected that other specifications will use this specification
   to define normative events.

   This specification is scoped to security and identity related events.
   While event tokens may be used for other purposes, the specification
   only considers security and privacy concerns relevant to identity and
   personal information.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  These
   keywords are capitalized when used to unambiguously specify
   requirements of the protocol or application features and behavior
   that affect the inter-operability and security of implementations.
   When these words are not capitalized, they are meant in their
   natural-language sense.

   For purposes of readability, examples are not URL encoded.
   Implementers MUST percent encode URLs as described in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC3986].

   Throughout this document, all figures MAY contain spaces and extra
   line-wrapping for readability and space limitations.  Similarly, some
   URIs contained within examples have been shortened for space and
   readability reasons.

1.2.  Definitions

   The following definitions are used with SETs:

   Feed Publisher
      The Feed Publisher creates SETs to be distributed to registered
      subscribers.  In JWT terminology, the Feed Publisher is also known
      as the issuer ("iss").

   Security Event Token (SET)
      An SET is a JWT that is to be distributed to one or more
      registered subscribers.  A SET MAY be signed or encrypted using
      JWS and/or JWE for authentication and confidentiality reasons.

   Feed
      A Feed is a logical grouping of SETs or a context under which SETs
      may be issued.  A Subscriber registers with the Feed Publisher to
      subscribe to SETs associated with a Feed.  How a Feed is defined
      or the method for subscription is out-of-scope of this
      specification.

   Subscriber
      A Subscriber registers to receive SETs from a Feed Publisher using
      a protocol such as HTTP.  The method of registration and delivery
      is out-of-scope of this specification.

   Security Subject

Internet-Draft          draft-hunt-idevent-token             August 2016


      A Security Subject is the entity to which a SET refers.  A
      Security Subject may be a principle (e.g., Section 4.1.2
      [RFC7519]), a web resource, or other thing such as an IP address
      that a SET might reference.

2.  The Security Event Token (SET)

   A SET conveys a statement (in the form of a JWT [RFC7519]) about a
   single security event in relation to a Security Subject that may be
   of interest to a Subscriber or set of Subscribers receiving SETs from
   a Feed Publisher.

   The schema and structure of a SET follows the JWT [RFC7519]
   specification.  A SET has the following characteristics:

   o  An outer JSON structure that acts as the event envelope.  The
      envelope contains a set of attributes common to every SET.  The
      attributes are used to validate the event and determine the event
      data included.  The envelope includes an "events" attribute
      describing the type of event, and

   o  One or more JSON [RFC7159] sub-objects (payloads) that contain one
      or more attributes associated with the event URIs values provided
      in the envelope "events" attribute.

   o  While a SET may have more than one URI value for "events", the
      intent is that the additional URIs are to provide additional
      attributes related to the same event in the form of extensions to
      the primary event.

   SET payload objects are added to the envelope by adding an attribute
   to the top-level JSON object (the envelope) whose name corresponds to
   a value from "events".  The payload object contains the attributes
   relevant to the specified event URI.  For example, SET event payloads
   may include "iss" attribute to distinguish between the issuer of the
   event and the issuer of a Security Subject or "sub".

   The following is a non-normative example showing a hypothetical SCIM
   password reset SET.  The example also shows an example where the
   issuer has provided an extension ("https://example.com/scim/event/
   passwordResetExt") that is used to convey additional information such
   as the current count of reset attempts:

   {
     "jti": "3d0c3cf797584bd193bd0fb1bd4e7d30",
     "events":[
       "urn:ietf:params:scim:event:passwordReset",
       "https://example.com/scim/event/passwordResetExt"
     ],
     "iat": 1458496025,
     "iss": "https://scim.example.com",
     "aud":[
       "https://jhub.example.com/Feeds/98d52461fa5bbc879593b7754",
       "https://jhub.example.com/Feeds/5d7604516b1d08641d7676ee7"
     ],
     "urn:ietf:params:scim:event:passwordReset":{
       "iss":"https://scim.example.com",
       "id":"44f6142df96bd6ab61e7521d9",
       "sub":"/Users/44f6142df96bd6ab61e7521d9"
     },
     "https://example.com/scim/event/passwordResetExt":{
        "resetAttempts":5
     }
   }

                Figure 1: Example SCIM Password Reset Event

   The event in the figure above expresses hypothetical password reset
   event for SCIM [RFC7644].  The JWT consists of:

   o  An _events_ attribute specifying the hypothetical SCIM urn
      ("urn:ietf:params:scim:event:passwordReset") for a password reset,
      and a custom extension, "https://example.com/scim/event/
      passwordResetExt", that is used to provide additional event
      information presumably specified by the location URI provided.

   o  An "iss" attribute, denotes the event publisher in the envelope
      while the "iss" in the event payload specifies the SCIM service
      provider for the account that was reset.

   o  The "aud" attribute specifies the intended audience for the event.
      In practical terms, this MAY be the URI for the event Feed that a
      client has subscribed to.

Internet-Draft          draft-hunt-idevent-token             August 2016


   Additional extensions to an event may be added by adding more values
   to the "events" attribute.  For each event URI value specified, there
   MAY be a corresponding attribute that has a JSON object that contains
   the attributes associated with that event (e.g.,
   "https://example.com/scim/event/passwordResetExt").  In this example,
   the SCIM event indicates that a password has been updated and the
   current password reset count is 5.  Notice that the value for
   "resetAttempts" is actually part of its own JSON object
   "https://example.com/scim/event/passwordResetExt".

   Here is another example event token, this one for a Logout Token:

   {
     "iss": "https://server.example.com",
     "aud": "https://rp.example.com",
     "jti": "3d0c3cf797584bd193bd0fb1bd4e7d30",
     "iat": 1458668180,
     "exp": 1458668580,
     "events": [
       "https://specs.openid.net/logout"
     ],
     "https://specs.openid.net/logout": {
       "iss": "https://token.example.com",
       "sub": "248289761001",
       "jti": "08a5019c-17e1-4977-8f42-65a12843ea02"
     }
   }

                   Figure 2: Example OpenID Logout Event

   In the above example, the event has its own issuer,
   "https://server.example.com" while the event is about the logging out
   of a user session identified in the event extension by "jti" that was
   issued by "https://token.example.com".

   In the following example, a fictional medical service collects
   consent for medical actions and notifies other parties.  The
   individual for whom consent is identified was originally
   authenticated via OpenID Connect.  In this case, the issuer of the
   SET event is an application rather than the OpenID provider:

   {
     "jti": "fb4e75b5411e4e19b6c0fe87950f7749",
     "events":[
       "https://openid.net/heart/consent.html"
     ],
     "iat": 1458496025,
     "iss": "https://my.examplemed.com",
     "aud":[
       "https://rp.example.com"
     ],
     "https://openid.net/heart/consent":{
       "iss": "https://token.example.com",
       "sub": "248289761001",
       "consentUri":[
         "https://terms.examplemed.com/labdisclosure.html#Agree"
       ]
     }
   }

                      Figure 3: Example Consent Event

   In the above example "iss" and "sub" contained within the attribute
   "https://openid.net/heart/consent", refer to the subject and issuer
   of the original OpendID Provider.  They are distinct from the top
   level value of "iss" which always refers to the issuer of the event -
   a medical consent service that is a relying party to the OpenID
   Provider.

2.1.  Core SET Attributes

   The following are attributes that are based on [RFC7519] claim
   definitions and are profiled for use in an event token:

   jti
      As defined by Section 4.1.7 [RFC7519] contains a unique identifier
      for an event.  The identifier SHOULD be unique within a particular
      event Feed and MAY be used by clients to track whether a
      particular event has already been received.  This attribute is
      REQUIRED.

   iss

Internet-Draft          draft-hunt-idevent-token             August 2016


      A single valued String containing the URI of the service provider
      publishing the SET (the issuer).  This attribute is REQUIRED.

   aud
      A multi-valued String containing the URIs representing the
      audience of the event.  Values are typically URLs of the Feeds the
      event is associated with.  When an event has multiple audiences
      that go to the same subscriber, the publisher is not obligated to
      deliver repeated events to the same subscriber.  This attribute is
      RECOMMENDED.

   iat
      As defined by Section 4.1.6 [RFC7519], a value containing a
      NumericDate, which represents when the event was issued.  Unless
      otherwise specified, the value SHOULD be interpreted by the
      subscriber as equivalent to the actual time of the event.  This
      attribute is REQUIRED.

   nbf
      As defined by Section 4.1.5 [RFC7519], a value containing a
      NumericDate, which represents a future date when the event will
      occur.  This attribute is OPTIONAL.

   The following is a new attribute defined by this specification:

   events
      A multi-valued String that contains one or more URIs representing
      the type of event being expressed and the attributes that MAY be
      available within the JWT.  Each value in this attribute indicates
      what other JSON sub-objects MAY present within the parent JSON SET
      structure.  Each JSON sub-object is denoted by an attribute that
      matches a value in "events".  This attribute is REQUIRED.

2.2.  Security Event Token Construction

   A SET is a JWT [RFC7519] that is constructed by building a JSON
   structure that constitutes an event object and which is then used as
   the body of a JWT.

   While this specification uses JWT to convey a SET, implementers SHALL
   NOT use SETs to convey authentication or authorization assertions.

   The following is an example event token (which has been formatted for

    "iat": 1458496404,
    "iss": "https://scim.example.com",
    "aud":[

     "https://scim.example.com/Feeds/5d7604516b1d08641d7676ee7"
    ],

    "events":[
      "urn:ietf:params:scim:event:create"
    ],
    "urn:ietf:params:scim:event:create":{
      "ref": "https://scim.example.com/Users/44f6142df96bd6ab61e7521d9",
      "attributes":["id", "name", "userName", "password", "emails"],
      "values":{
        "emails":[
         {"type":"work", "value":"jdoe@example.com"}
        ],
        "password":"not4u2no",
        "userName":"jdoe",
        "id":"44f6142df96bd6ab61e7521d9",
        "name":{
          "givenName":"John",
          "familyName":"Doe"
        }
      }
    }
  }

                     Figure 4: Example Event JSON Data

   When transmitted, the above JSON body must be converted into a JWT as
   per [RFC7519].  In this example, because the event contains attribute
   values, the token MUST be encrypted per JWE (see [RFC7516]) before
   transmission.

   The following is an example of a SCIM Event expressed as an unsecured
   JWT.  The JWT header of:

   {"alg":"none"}

                  Figure 5: Example Unsecured Event Token

   To create and or validate a signed or encrypted SET, follow the
   instructions in section 7 of [RFC7519].

3.  Security Considerations

   SETs may often contain sensitive information.  Therefore, methods for
   distribution of events SHOULD require the use of a transport-layer
   security mechanism when distributing events.  Parties MUST support
   TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] and MAY support additional transport-layer
   mechanisms meeting its security requirements.  When using TLS, the
   client MUST perform a TLS/SSL server certificate check, per
   [RFC6125].  Implementation security considerations for TLS can be
   found in "Recommendations for Secure Use of TLS and DTLS" [RFC7525].

   Security Events distributed through third-parties or that carry
   personally identifiable information, SHOULD be encrypted using JWE
   [RFC7516] or secured for confidentiality by other means.

   Security Events distributed without authentication over the channel,
   such as via TLS ([RFC5246] and [RFC6125]), and/or OAuth2 [RFC6749],
   or Basic Authentication [RFC7617], MUST be signed using JWS [RFC7515]
   so that individual events MAY be authenticated and validated by the
   subscriber.

4.  Privacy Considerations

   If a SET needs to be retained for audit purposes, JWS MAY be used to
   provide verification of its authenticity.

   Event Publishers SHOULD attempt to specialize Feeds so that the
   content is targeted to the specific business and protocol needs of
   subscribers.

   When sharing personally identifiable information or information that
   is otherwise considered confidential to affected users, the
   publishers and subscribers MUST have the appropriate legal agreements
   and user consent in place.

   The propagation of subject identifiers can be perceived as personally
   identifiable information.  Where possible, publishers and subscribers
   should devise approaches that prevent propagation -- for example, the
   passing of a hash value that requires the subscriber to already know
   the subject.
