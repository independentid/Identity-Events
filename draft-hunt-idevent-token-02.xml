    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines an Identity Event token which may
      be distributed via a protocol such as HTTP. An identity event token 
      is based on the JSON Web Token and may be optionally signed and/or encrypted. It 
      describes a statement of fact that may be shared by an event publisher
      with registered subscribers.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction and Overview" toc="default">
      <t>This specification defines an extensible event token format which may
      be exchanged using protocols such as HTTP. The specification builds
      on the JSON Web Token format <xref target="RFC7519"/> in order to provide a self-contained 
      message "token" that can be optionally signed using JSON Web Signature <xref target="RFC7515"/>
      and/or encrypted using JSON Web Encryption <xref target="RFC7516"/>.</t>
      
      <t>For the purpose of this specification an "event" is a statement
      of fact by a publisher (also known as an issuer) that the state of 
      a resource it controls has changed in some way (explicitly or 
      implicitly). A resource may be permanent (e.g. a User account) or 
      temporary (e.g. a login session) in nature. A resource state change 
      may include direct changes to state or implicit changes to state 
      or other higher-level security statements such as:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>The creation, modification, removal of a resource.</t>
        <t>The reseting or suspension of an account.</t>
        <t>The revoking of a security token before its expiry.</t>
        <t>The logout of a user session. Or, </t>
        <t>A cumulative conclusion such as to indicate that a user has 
        taken over an email identifier that may have been used in the 
        past by another user.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
      
      <t>Based on some agreed upon criteria for an event feed, 
      the publisher distributes the event to the appropriate subscribers.
      While an event may be delivered via synchronous means (e.g. HTTP POST),
      the distribution of the event often happens asynchronously to the 
      original action which generated the event. 
      For example, an OAuth2 Authorization server <xref target="RFC6749"/>, 
      having received an token revocation request <xref target="RFC7009"/>, 
      may issue a token revocation event to downstream web resource
      providers. Having been informed of a token revocation, the resource
      server may add the token identifier to its local revocation list 
      assuming the token has not already expired.</t>
      
      <t>A subscriber having received an event, validates and interprets the
      event and takes its own independent action, if any. For example, 
      having been informed of a personal identifier now being associated 
      with a different resource (i.e. is being used by someone-else), the 
      subscriber may choose to ensure that the new user is not granted 
      access to resources associated with the previous user. Or it may
      not have any relationship with the subject and no action is taken.</t>
      
      <t>While subscribers will often take actions upon receiving one
      or more events, events MUST NOT be assumed to be commands or requests. 
      To do so requires complex bi-directional signalling and error recovery 
      mechanisms which fall outside the scope of this specification. 
      The intent of this specification is to define a way of exchanging 
      statements of fact that subscribers may interpret for their own
      purposes. Since Events are typically historical statements by a publisher
      and are not commands, idempotency or or lack there of, does not apply.</t>
      
      <t>Unless otherwise specified, this specification uses example 
      events intended as non-normative examples showing how an event may be 
      used. It is expected that other specifications will use
      this specification to define normative events.</t>
      
      <t>This specification is scoped to security and identity related events.
      While event tokens may be used for other purposes, the specification
      only considers security and privacy concerns relevant to identity 
      and personal information.</t>

      <section anchor="notat" title="Notational Conventions" toc="default">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119"/>. These keywords are capitalized when used to
        unambiguously specify requirements of the protocol or application
        features and behavior that affect the inter-operability and security of
        implementations. When these words are not capitalized, they are meant
        in their natural-language sense.</t>

        <t>For purposes of readability examples are not URL encoded.
        Implementers MUST percent encode URLs as described in <xref
        target="RFC3986">Section 2.1 of</xref>.</t>

        <t>Throughout this documents all figures MAY contain spaces and extra
        line-wrapping for readability and space limitations. Similarly, some
        URI's contained within examples, have been shortened for space and

          The following definitions are used with Identity Events:

      associated with that event (e.g. 
      <spanx style="verb">https://example.com/scim/event/password</spanx>).
      In this example, the SCIM event indicates that a password has been updated 
      and the current password reset count is 5. Notice that the value for 
      "resetAttempts" is actually part of its own JSON object

            a particular event feed and MAY be used by clients to track
            whether a particular event has already been received. This 
            attribute is REQUIRED.</t>

            <t hangText="iss"><vspace blankLines="0"/>A single valued
            String containing the URI of the service provider publishing
            the event (the issuer). For example, in SCIM protocol

            resource, the <spanx style="verb">jti</spanx> of a revoked
            token, or some meaningful identifier. Some example resources

        <t>To create and or validate a signed or encrypted event token follow
        the instructions in section 7 of <xref

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations" toc="default">

      <t>Events may often contain sensitive information. Therefore
      methods for distribution of events SHOULD require the use of a 
      transport-layer security mechanism when distributing events. 
      Parties MUST support TLS 1.2 <xref target="RFC5246"/> and MAY support
      additional transport-layer mechanisms meeting its security
      requirements. When using TLS, the client MUST perform a TLS/SSL server
      certificate check, per <xref target="RFC6125"/>. Implementation
      security considerations for TLS can be found in "Recommendations for
      Secure Use of TLS and DTLS" <xref target="RFC7525"/>.</t>
      
      <t>Events distributed through third-parties or that carry personally
      identifiable information, SHOULD be encrypted using JWE <xref target="RFC7516"/>
      or secured for confidentiality by other means.
      </t>
      <t>Events distributed without authentication over the channel, such
      as via TLS (<xref target="RFC5246"/> and <xref target="RFC6125"/>), 
      and/or OAuth2 <xref target="RFC6749"/>, or Basic Authentication <xref target="RFC7617"/>,
      MUST be signed using JWS <xref target="RFC7515"></xref> so
      that individual events MAY be authenticated and validated by the subscriber.</t>
      
    </section>
    <section title="Privacy Considerations">
    
      <t>If an event needs to be retained for audit purposes, JWS MAY 
      be used to provide verification of its authenticity.</t>
      
      <t>Publishers should attempt to specialize feeds so that the content
      is targeted to the specific business and protocol needs of subscribers.</t>
      
      <t>When sharing personally identifiable information or information
      that is otherwise considered confidential to affected users, the 
      publishers and subscribers MUST have the appropriate legal agreements
      and user consent in place.</t>
      
      <t>The propagation of subject identifiers can be perceived as personally
      identifiable information. Where possible, publishers and subscribers
      should devise approaches the prevents propagation. For example the
      passing of a hash value that requires the subscriber to already know
      the subject.</t>
