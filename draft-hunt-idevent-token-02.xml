    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines the Security Event token which may
      be distributed via a protocol such as HTTP. A Security Event Token 
      (SET) is based on the JSON Web Token and may be optionally signed 
      and/or encrypted. A SET describes a statement of fact that may be 
      shared by an event publisher with registered subscribers.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction and Overview" toc="default">
      <t>This specification defines an extensible security event token 
      (SET) format which may be exchanged using protocols such as HTTP. 
      The specification builds on the JSON Web Token format <xref target="RFC7519"/> 
      in order to provide a self-contained token that can be optionally 
      signed using JSON Web Signature <xref target="RFC7515"/>
      and/or encrypted using JSON Web Encryption <xref target="RFC7516"/>.</t>
      
      <t>For the purpose of this specification an event is a statement
      of fact by a publisher (also known as the event issuer) that the state of 
      a security subject (e.g. a web resource, token, IP address) it 
      controls or is aware of, has changed in some way (explicitly or 
      implicitly). A security subject may be permanent (e.g. a User account) or 
      temporary (e.g. a login session) in nature. A state change 
      may include direct changes of entity state, implicit changes to state 
      or other higher-level security statements such as:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>The creation, modification, removal of a resource.</t>
        <t>The reseting or suspension of an account.</t>
        <t>The revoking of a security token prior to its expiry.</t>
        <t>The logout of a user session. Or, </t>
        <t>A cumulative conclusion such as to indicate that a user has 
        taken over an email identifier that may have been used in the 
        past by another user.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
      
      <t>Based on some agreed upon criteria for an event feed, 
      the publisher distributes events to the appropriate subscribers.
      While an event may be delivered via synchronous means (e.g. HTTP POST),
      the distribution of the event often happens asynchronously to the 
      change of state which generated the security event. As an example, 
      an OAuth2 Authorization server <xref target="RFC6749"/>, 
      having received a token revocation request <xref target="RFC7009"/>, 
      may issue a token revocation event to downstream web resource
      providers. Having been informed of a token revocation, the OAuth2 web
      resource service provider may add the token identifier to its 
      local revocation list assuming the token has not already expired.</t>
      
      <t>A subscriber having received an event, validates and interprets the
      event and takes its own independent action, if any. For example, 
      having been informed of a personal identifier now being associated 
      with a different security subject (i.e. is being used by someone-else), the 
      subscriber may choose to ensure that the new user is not granted 
      access to resources associated with the previous user. Or it may
      not have any relationship with the subject and no action is taken.</t>
      
      <t>While subscribers will often take actions upon receiving one
      or more events, events MUST NOT be assumed to be commands or requests. 
      To do so requires complex bi-directional signals and error recovery 
      mechanisms which fall outside the scope of this specification. 
      The intent of this specification is to define a way of exchanging 
      statements of fact that subscribers may interpret for their own
      purposes. Since events are typically historical statements by a publisher
      and are not commands, idempotency or lack there of, does not apply.</t>
      
      <t>Unless otherwise specified, this specification uses example 
      events intended as non-normative examples showing how an event may be 
      used. It is expected that other specifications will use
      this specification to define normative events.</t>
      
      <t>This specification is scoped to security and identity related events.
      While event tokens may be used for other purposes, the specification
      only considers security and privacy concerns relevant to identity 
      and personal information.</t>

        <t>
          The following definitions are used with Identity Events:
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Feed Publisher"><vspace blankLines="0"/>The Feed Publisher provides
              events to be distributed to registered subscribers. In JWT
              terminology, the Feed Publisher is also known as the issuer
              <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx>).
            </t>

            <t hangText="Event"><vspace blankLines="0"/>An event is a 
              security event token that is a statement that is to be
              distributed to one or more registered subscribers. An event is
              constructed as a JWT token and MAY be signed or encrypted using
              JWS/JWE for authentication and confidentiality reasons.
            </t>

            <t hangText="Feed"><vspace blankLines="0"/>A feed a logical
              grouping of events or a context under which events may be issued. 
              An interested client registers with the Feed Publisher to subscribe
              to events associated with a feed. How a feed is defined or
              the method for subscription is out-of-scope of this specification.
            </t>
            
            <t hangText="Subscriber"><vspace blankLines="0"/>A Subscriber registers to receive event
              notifications from a Feed Publisher using a protocol such as
              HTTP. The method of registration and delivery is out-of-scope
              of this specification.
            </t>
            
            <t hangText="Security Subject"><vspace blankLines="0"/>The security subject about which
            the event is about. A security subject may be a principle 
            (e.g. <xref target="RFC7519">Section 4.1.2</xref>), a web resource,
            or other thing such as an IP address about which an Event is about.</t>

    <section anchor="events" title="Events">
      <t>A SET conveys a statement (in the form of a JWT token
      <xref target="RFC7519"/>) about a Security Subject that may be of 
      interest to a subscriber or set of subscribers receiving events from
      a Feed Publisher.</t>
      
      <t>The schema and structure of an event follows the JWT <xref target="RFC7519"/>
      specification. An event token has the following characteristics:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>a common set of attributes common to every event at the top level
        including an events attribute describing the type of event, and</t>
        <t>one or more JSON sub-objects 
        that attributes associated with an event URI value. The attributes
        to be included with any particular event are to be defined by the event
        as specified by the event URI value in the <spanx style="verb">events</spanx>
        attribute.</t>
      </list>
      In addition to the JWT attributes <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> 
      and <spanx style="verb">aud</spanx>, an SET contains the 
      attribute <spanx style="verb">events</spanx> with at least one 
      URI value used to indicate the type of event that has occurred and what
      information (attributes) may be present in the event token. 
      and what type of event (e.g. resource modified) is contained in the 
      event token.</t>
      
      <t>An event MAY contain an attribute for each value of <spanx style="verb">events</spanx>
      whose value is a JSON object (also known as an event extension object)
      that contains additional attributes relevant to the specified event URI.
      For example, many events will include an <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> 
      that identifies the context of the Security Subject being reported 
      (as distinct from the issuer of the SET), and a <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> or 
      <spanx style="verb">jti</spanx> or some other attribute that uniquely identifies
      the Security Subject. </t>

      </figure>      
      <t>The event in the figure above expresses hypothetical password
      reset event for SCIM <xref target="RFC7644"/>. The JWT consists of:<list style="symbols">
        <t>An <spanx>events</spanx> attribute specifying the hypothetical 
        SCIM urn (<spanx style="verb">urn:ietf:params:scim:event:passwordReset</spanx>) 
        for a password reset, and a custom extension, 
        <spanx style="verb">https://example.com/scim/event/password</spanx>, 
        that is used to provide additional event information presumably 
        specified by the location URI provided.</t>
        <t>An <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx>
        attribute which denotes the event publisher.</t>
        <t>The <spanx style="verb">aud</spanx> attribute specifies the 
        intended audience for the event. In practical terms this MAY be 
        the URI for the event feed that a client has subscribed to.
        </t>
      </list></t>
      
      <t>Additional extensions to an event may be added by adding more 
      values to the <spanx style="verb">events</spanx> attribute. For 
      each event URI value specified, there MAY be a corresponding 
      attribute that has a JSON object that contains the attributes 
      associated with that event (e.g. 
      <spanx style="verb">https://example.com/scim/event/password</spanx>).
      In this example, the SCIM event indicates that a password has been updated 
      and the current password reset count is 5. Notice that the value for 
      "resetAttempts" is actually part of its own JSON object 
      <spanx style="verb">https://example.com/scim/event/password</spanx>.

        <t>To create and or validate a signed or encrypted SET follow
        the instructions in section 7 of <xref
        target="RFC7519"/>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations" toc="default">

      <t>SETs may often contain sensitive information. Therefore
      methods for distribution of events SHOULD require the use of a 
      transport-layer security mechanism when distributing events. 
      Parties MUST support TLS 1.2 <xref target="RFC5246"/> and MAY support
      additional transport-layer mechanisms meeting its security
      requirements. When using TLS, the client MUST perform a TLS/SSL server
      certificate check, per <xref target="RFC6125"/>. Implementation
      security considerations for TLS can be found in "Recommendations for
      Secure Use of TLS and DTLS" <xref target="RFC7525"/>.</t>
      
      <t>Security Events distributed through third-parties or that carry personally
      identifiable information, SHOULD be encrypted using JWE <xref target="RFC7516"/>
      or secured for confidentiality by other means.
      </t>
      <t>Security Events distributed without authentication over the channel, such
      as via TLS (<xref target="RFC5246"/> and <xref target="RFC6125"/>), 
      and/or OAuth2 <xref target="RFC6749"/>, or Basic Authentication <xref target="RFC7617"/>,
      MUST be signed using JWS <xref target="RFC7515"></xref> so
      that individual events MAY be authenticated and validated by the subscriber.</t>
      
    </section>
    <section title="Privacy Considerations">
    
      <t>If an SET needs to be retained for audit purposes, JWS MAY 
      be used to provide verification of its authenticity.</t>
      
      <t>Event Publishers should attempt to specialize feeds so that the content
      is targeted to the specific business and protocol needs of subscribers.</t>
      
      <t>When sharing personally identifiable information or information
      that is otherwise considered confidential to affected users, the 
      publishers and subscribers MUST have the appropriate legal agreements
      and user consent in place.</t>
      
      <t>The propagation of subject identifiers can be perceived as personally
      identifiable information. Where possible, publishers and subscribers
      should devise approaches the prevents propagation. For example the
      passing of a hash value that requires the subscriber to already know
      the subject.</t>
