    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines an Identity Event token which may
      be distributed via a protocol such as HTTP. An identity event token 
      is based on the JSON Web Token and may be optionally signed and/or encrypted. It 
      describes a statement of fact that may be shared by an event publisher
      with registered subscribers.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction and Overview" toc="default">
      <t>This specification defines an extensible event token format which may
      be exchanged using protocols such as HTTP. The specification builds
      on the JSON Web Token format <xref target="RFC7519"/> in order to provide a self-contained 
      message "token" that can be optionally signed using JSON Web Signature <xref target="RFC7515"/>
      and/or encrypted using JSON Web Encryption <xref target="RFC7516"/>.</t>
      
      <t>For the purpose of this specification an "event" is a statement
      of fact by a publisher (also known as an issuer) that the state of 
      a resource it controls has changed in some way (explicitly or 
      implicitly). Based on some agreed upon criteria for an event feed, 
      the publisher distributes the event to the appropriate subscribers.</t>
      
      <t>[[Background: to be removed from final specification]]At the time 
      of writing of this specifications there are several discussions regarding the need 
      for identity events. Some of these include:<list style="symbols">
        <t>Events to allow SCIM resource co-ordination between SCIM domains.</t>
        <t>OAuth Token Revocation (see <xref target="RFC7009"/>)</t>
        <t>OpenID Logout or downstream logout notification.</t>
        <t>Session Cancellation</t>
        <t>OpenID Risk Incident Sharing and Coordination (RISC) Events. See <xref target="RISC"/></t>
        <t>The HEART WG <xref target="HEART"/> which intends to define privacy and security related events
        in health-related data sharing APIs.</t>
      </list>This specification uses example SCIM events which are intended
      to be non-normative for the purpose of showing how an event may be 
      used in practice.</t>
      
      <t>A resource state change event typically includes explicit operation events such as:
      a resource has been created, modified, removed, or updated in some way.</t>
      
      <t>In addition to explicit operations there may be higher-level statements 
      made that describe an effect resulting from a change. For example, a
      publisher may wish to indicate that a user resource has taken over an email
      identifier that may have been used in the past. This cumulative event 
      is a high-level statement that takes into account that another resource 
      had a personal identifier that potentially conflicts with a newer resource.
      Because of the security impact, the publisher wishes to
      notify its subscribers of the identifier re-use. In this way, the event
      is not describing a particular state change to a resource, it describes
      a meta-conclusion based on its own business and security rules (this
      scenario is often called an 'account takeover' event).</t>
      
      <t>A subscriber having received an event, validates and interprets the
      event and takes its own independent action, if any. For example, 
      having been informed of a personal identifier now being associated 
      with a different resource (i.e. is being used by someone-else), the 
      subscriber may choose to ensure that the new user is not granted 
      access to resources associated with the previous user.</t>
      
      <t>Events SHOULD NOT be used to convey commands or requests. To do so
      requires complex bidirectional signalling and error recovery mechanisms which fall
      outside the scope of this specification. The intent of this specification
      is to define a way of exchanging historical statements of fact that 
      subscribers may interpret for their own use.</t>
      
      <t>This specification is scoped to security and identity related events.
      While event tokens may be used for other purposes, the specification
      only considers security and privacy concerns relevant to identity 
      and personal information.</t>
      
      <t>This specification may be optionally used with the identity
      event subscription management specification which provides the details 
      of event feeds and how subscribers register for events(see 
      <xref target="idevent-subscription"/>), defines a protocol registry for
      event transmission methods including transmission using HTTP.</t>

        unambiguously specify requirements of the protocol or application

        <t>
          The following definitions are used with Identity Events:
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Feed Publisher"><vspace blankLines="0"/>The Feed Provider publishes
              events to be distributed to registered subscribers. In JWT
              terminology, the Feed Publisher is also known as the issuer
              <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx>).
            </t>

            <t hangText="Event"><vspace blankLines="0"/>An event is a resource change statement that is to be
              distributed to one or more registered subscribers. An event is
              constructed as a JWT token and MAY be signed or encrypted using
              JWS/JWE for authentication and confidentiality reasons.
            </t>

            <t hangText="Feed"><vspace blankLines="0"/>A feed is a URI that describes the set of
              resources and events under which events may be issued. An
              interested client registers with the Feed Provider to subscribe
              to events associated with a feed. When expressed in a JWT token,
              a feed is defined as the event's audience (<spanx style="verb">aud</spanx>).
            </t>
            <t hangText="Subscriber"><vspace blankLines="0"/>A Subscriber registers to receive event
              notifications from a Feed Provider using a protocol such as
              HTTP.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="events" title="Events">
      <t>An identity event conveys a message (in the form of a JWT token <xref target="RFC7519"/>) about 
      a resource (i.e. a security subject) that may be of interest to a 
      subscriber or set of subscribers participating in an event feed 
      (see <xref target="idevent-subscription"/>).</t>
      
      <t>In addition to the JWT attributes <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> and 
      <spanx style="verb">aud</spanx>, an event message contains the attribute 
      <spanx style="verb">events</spanx> with at least one value. 
      The event URI values indicate what event information (attributes) 
      and what type of event (e.g. resource modified) is contained in the 
      event message. The definition of registered events are found in the 
      event registry (see <xref target="registry"/>), and implementers are free to
      define their own event types.</t>

      <t>The schema and structure of an event follows the JWT <xref target="RFC7519"/>. 
      An event JWT has the following characteristics:<list style="symbols">
        <t>a common set of attributes common to every event, and</t>
        <t>one or more event extensions

      </figure>      
      <t>The event in the figure above expresses hypothetical password
      reset event for SCIM. The JWT consists of an <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx>
      attribute which denotes the event publisher. The <spanx style="verb">aud</spanx>
      attribute specifies the intended audience for the event. In practical 
      terms this MAY be the the URI for the event feed that a client has 
      subscribed to.</t>
      
      <t>Additional extensions to an event may be added by adding more values
      to the <spanx style="verb">events</spanx> attribute. For each event URI
      value specified, there is a corresponding attribute that has its on JSON
      object that contains the attributes associated with that event (e.g. 
      <spanx style="verb">https://example.com/scim/event/password</spanx>).
      In this example, the SCIM event indicates that a password has been updated 
      and the current password reset count is 5. Notice that the value for 
      "resetAttempts" is actually part of its own JSON object 
      <spanx style="verb">https://example.com/scim/event/password</spanx>.
