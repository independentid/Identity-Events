       Push-Based Security Event Token (SET) Delivery Using HTTP
                    draft-ietf-secevent-http-push-03

Abstract

   This specification defines how a Security Event Token (SET) may be
   delivered to an intended recipient using HTTP POST.  The SET is
   transmitted in the body of an HTTP POST request to an endpoint
   operated by the recipient, and the recipient indicates successful or
   failed transmission via the HTTP response.

1.  Introduction and Overview

   This specification defines a mechanism by which a transmitter of a
   Security Event Token (SET) [RFC8417] may deliver the SET to an
   intended recipient via HTTP POST [RFC7231].

   Push-Based SET Delivery over HTTP POST is intended for scenarios
   where all of the following apply:





Backman, et al.           Expires July 21, 2019                 [Page 2]

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-secevent-http-push         January 2019


   o  The transmitter of the SET is capable of making outbound HTTP
      requests.

   o  The recipient is capable of hosting an HTTP endpoint that is
      accessible to the transmitter.

   o  The transmitter and recipient are known to one another.

   A mechanism for exchanging configuration metadata such as endpoint
   URLs and cryptographic key parameters between the transmitter and
   receipt is out of scope for this specifications.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Throughout this documents all figures may contain spaces and extra
   line-wrapping for readability and due to space limitations.

1.2.  Definitions

   This specification utilizes terminology defined in [RFC8417], as well
   as the terms defined below:

   SET Transmitter
      An entity that delivers SETs in its possession to one or more SET
      Recipients, as defined in [RFC8417].

   SET Recipient
      An entity that receives SETs through some distribution method, as
      defined in [RFC8417].

2.  SET Delivery

   To deliver a SET to a given SET Recipient, the SET Transmitter makes
   a SET Transmission Request to the SET Recipient, with the SET itself
   contained within the request.  The SET Recipient replies to this
   request with a response either acknowledging successful transmission
   of the SET, or indicating that an error occurred while receiving,
   parsing, and/or validating the SET.

   Upon receipt of a SET, the SET Recipient SHALL validate that all of
   the following are true:




Backman, et al.           Expires July 21, 2019                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-secevent-http-push         January 2019


   o  The SET Recipient can parse the SET.

   o  The SET is authentic (i.e., it was issued by the issuer specified
      within the SET).

   o  The SET Recipient is identified as an intended audience of the
      SET.

   o  The SET issuer is recognized as an issuer that the SET Recipient
      is willing to receive SETs from (e.g., the issuer is whitelisted
      by the SET Recipient).

   The mechanisms by which the SET Recipient performs this validation
   are out of scope for this document.  SET parsing and issuer and
   audience identification are defined in [RFC8417].  The mechanism for
   validating the authenticity of a SET is implementation specific, and
   may vary depending on the authentication mechanisms in use, and
   whether the SET is signed and/or encrypted (See Section 3).

   The SET Recipient SHOULD ensure that the SET is persisted in a way
   that is sufficient to meet the SET Recipient's own reliability
   requirements, and MUST NOT expect or depend on a SET Transmitter to
   re-transmit or otherwise make available to the SET Recipient a SET
   once the SET Recipient acknowledges that it was received
   successfully.

   Once the SET has been validated and persisted, the SET Recipient
   SHOULD immediately return a response indicating that the SET was
   successfully delivered.  The SET Recipient SHOULD NOT perform
   extensive business logic that processes the event expressed by the
   SET prior to sending this response.  Such logic SHOULD be executed
   asynchronously from delivery, in order to minimize the expense and
   impact of SET delivery on the SET Transmitter.

   The SET Transmitter MAY re-transmit a SET if the responses from
   previous transmissions timed out or indicated potentially recoverable
   error (such as server unavailability that may be transient, or a
   decryption failure that may be due to misconfigured keys on the SET
   Recipient's side).  In all other cases, the SET Transmitter SHOULD
   NOT re-transmit a SET.  The SET Transmitter SHOULD delay
   retransmission for an appropriate amount of time to avoid
   overwhelming the SET Recipient (see Section 4).

2.1.  Transmitting a SET

   To transmit a SET to a SET Recipient, the SET Transmitter makes an
   HTTP POST request to an HTTP endpoint provided by the SET Recipient.
   The "Content-Type" header of this request MUST be "application/



Backman, et al.           Expires July 21, 2019                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-secevent-http-push         January 2019


   secevent+jwt" as defined in Sections 2.2 and 6.2 of [RFC8417], and
   the "Accept" header MUST be "application/json".  The request body
   MUST consist of the SET itself, represented as a JWT [RFC7519].

   The SET Transmitter MAY include in the request an "Accept-Language"
   header to indicate to the SET Recipient the preferred language(s) in
   which to receive error messages.

   The mechanisms by which the SET Transmitter determines the HTTP
   endpoint to use when transmitting a SET to a given SET Recipient are
   not defined by this specification and may be implementation-specific.

   The following is a non-normative example of a SET transmission
   request:

   POST /Events  HTTP/1.1
   Host: notify.rp.example.com
   Accept: application/json
   Accept-Language: en-US, en;q=0.5
   Content-Type: application/secevent+jwt

2.2.  Success Response

   If the SET is determined to be valid, the SET Recipient SHALL
   "acknowledge" successful transmission by responding with HTTP
   Response Status Code 202 (Accepted) (see Section 6.3.3 of [RFC7231]).
   The body of the response MUST be empty.

   The following is a non-normative example of a successful receipt of a
   SET.

   HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted

              Figure 2: Example Successful Delivery Response

   Note that the purpose of the "acknowledgement" response is to let the
   SET Transmitter know that a SET has been delivered and the
   information no longer needs to be retained by the SET Transmitter.
   Before acknowledgement, SET Recipients SHOULD ensure they have
   validated received SETs and retained them in a manner appropriate to
   information retention requirements appropriate to the SET event types
   signaled.  The level and method of retention of SETs by SET
   Recipients is out of scope of this specification.

2.3.  Failure Response

   In the event of a general HTTP error condition, the SET Recipient MAY
   respond with an appropriate HTTP Status Code as defined in Section 6
   of [RFC7231].

   When the SET Recipient detects an error parsing or validating a SET
   transmitted in a SET Transmission Request, the SET Recipient SHALL
   respond with an HTTP Response Status Code of 400 (Bad Request).  The
   "Content-Type" header of this response MUST be "application/json",
   and the body MUST be a UTF-8 encoded JSON [RFC7159] object containing
   the following name/value pairs:

   err  A Security Event Token Error Code (see Section 2.4).

   description  A UTF-8 string containing a human-readable description
      of the error that MAY provide additional diagnostic information.
      The exact content of this field is implementation-specific.

   The response MUST include a "Content-Language" header, whose value
   indicates the language of the error descriptions included in the
   response body.  If the SET Recipient can provide error descriptions
   in multiple languages, they SHOULD choose the language to use
   according to the value of the "Accept-Language" header sent by the
   SET Transmitter in the transmission request, as described in
   Section 5.3.5 of [RFC7231].  If the SET Transmitter did not send an
   "Accept-Language" header, or if the SET Recipient does not support
   any of the languages included in the header, the SET Recipient MUST
   respond with messages that are understandable by an English-speaking
   person, as described in Section 4.5 of [RFC2277].

   Security Event Token Delivery Error Codes are strings that identify a
   specific category of error that may occur when parsing or validating
   a SET.  Every Security Event Token Delivery Error Code MUST have a

   +-----------------------+-------------------------------------------+

                     Table 1: SET Delivery Error Codes

3.  Authentication and Authorization

   The SET delivery method described in this specification is based upon
   HTTP and depends on the use of TLS and/or standard HTTP
   authentication and authorization schemes as per [RFC7235].

   Because SET Delivery describes a simple function, authorization for
   the ability to pick-up or deliver SETs can be derived by considering
   the identity of the SET issuer, or via other employed authentication
   methods.  Because SETs are not commands, SET Recipients are free to
   ignore SETs that are not of interest.

4.  Delivery Reliability

   Delivery reliability requirements may vary from implementation to
   implementation.  This specification defines the response from the SET
   Recipient in such a way as to provide the SET Transmitter with the
   information necessary to determine what further action is required,
   if any, in order to meet their requirements.  SET Transmitters with

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-secevent-http-push         January 2019


   high reliability requirements may be tempted to always retry failed
   transmissions, however it should be noted that for many types of SET
   delivery errors, a retry is extremely unlikely to be successful.  For
   example, "invalid_request" indicates a structural error in the
   content of the request body that is likely to remain when re-
   transmitting the same SET.  Others such as "access_denied" may be
   transient, for example if the SET Transmitter refreshes expired
   credentials prior to re-transmission.

   Implementers SHOULD evaluate their reliability requirements and the
   impact of various retry mechanisms on the performance of their
   systems to determine the correct strategy for various error
   conditions.

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Authentication Using Signed SETs

   In scenarios where HTTP authorization or TLS mutual authentication
   are not used or are considered weak, JWS signed SETs SHOULD be used
   (see [RFC7515] and Security Considerations [RFC8417]).  This enables
   the SET Recipient to validate that the SET issuer is authorized to
   deliver the SET.

5.2.  TLS Support Considerations

   SETs may contain sensitive information that is considered PII (e.g.,
   subject claims).  In such cases, SET Transmitters and SET Recipients
   MUST require the use of a transport-layer security mechanism.  Event
   delivery endpoints MUST support TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] and MAY support
   additional transport-layer mechanisms meeting its security
   requirements.  When using TLS, the client MUST perform a TLS/SSL
   server certificate check, per [RFC6125].  Implementation security
   considerations for TLS can be found in "Recommendations for Secure
   Use of TLS and DTLS" [RFC7525].

5.3.  Denial of Service

   The SET Recipient may be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack
   where a malicious party makes a high volume of requests containing
   invalid SETs, causing the endpoint to expend significant resources on
   cryptographic operations that are bound to fail.  This may be
   mitigated by authenticating SET Transmitters with a mechanism with
   low runtime overhead, such as mutual TLS.

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-secevent-http-push         January 2019


5.4.  Authenticating Persisted SETs

   At the time of receipt, the SET Recipient can rely upon transport
   layer mechanisms, HTTP authentication methods, and/or other context
   from the transmission request to authenticate the SET Transmitter and
   validate the authenticity of the SET.  However, this context is
   typically unavailable to systems that the SET Recipient forwards the
   SET onto, or to systems that retrieve the SET from storage.  If the
   SET Recipient requires the ability to validate SET authenticity
   outside of the context of the transmission request, then the SET
   Transmitter SHOULD sign the SET in accordance with [RFC7515] and
   optionally also encrypt it in accordance with [RFC7516].

6.  Privacy Considerations

   If a SET needs to be retained for audit purposes, a JWS signature MAY
   be used to provide verification of its authenticity.

   When sharing personally identifiable information or information that
   is otherwise considered confidential to affected users, SET
   Transmitters and Recipients MUST have the appropriate legal
   agreements and user consent or terms of service in place.

   The propagation of subject identifiers can be perceived as personally
   identifiable information.  Where possible, SET Transmitters and
   Recipients SHOULD devise approaches that prevent propagation -- for
   example, the passing of a hash value that requires the subscriber to
   already know the subject.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Security Event Token Delivery Error Codes

   This document defines Security Event Token Delivery Error Codes, for
   which IANA is asked to create and maintain a new registry titled
   "Security Event Token Delivery Error Codes".  Initial values for the
   Security Event Token Delivery Error Codes registry are given in
   Table 1.  Future assignments are to be made through the Expert Review
   registration policy ([RFC8126]) and shall follow the template
   presented in Section 7.1.1.

Appendix A.  Other Streaming Specifications

   [[EDITORS NOTE: This section to be removed prior to publication]]

   The following pub/sub, queuing, streaming systems were reviewed as
   possible solutions or as input to the current draft:

   XMPP Events

   The WG considered the XMPP events ands its ability to provide a
   single messaging solution without the need for both polling and push
   modes.  The feeling was the size and methodology of XMPP was to far
   apart from the current capabilities of the SECEVENTs community which
   focuses in on HTTP based service delivery and authorization.

   Amazon Simple Notification Service

   Simple Notification Service, is a pub/sub messaging product from AWS.
   SNS supports a variety of subscriber types: HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, AWS
   Lambda functions, email addresses (as JSON or plain text), phone
   numbers (via SMS), and AWS SQS standard queues.  It doesn't directly

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-secevent-http-push         January 2019


   support pull, but subscribers can get the pull model by creating an
   SQS queue and subscribing it to the topic.  Note that this puts the
   cost of pull support back onto the subscriber, just as it is in the
   push model.  It is not clear that one way is strictly better than the
   other; larger, sophisticated developers may be happy to own message
   persistence so they can have their own internal delivery guarantees.
   The long tail of OIDC clients may not care about that, or may fail to
   get it right.  Regardless, I think we can learn something from the
   Delivery Policies supported by SNS, as well as the delivery controls
   that SQS offers (e.g., Visibility Timeout, Dead-Letter Queues).  I'm
   not suggesting that we need all of these things in the spec, but they
   give an idea of what features people have found useful.

   Apache Kafka

   Apache Kafka is an Apache open source project based upon TCP for
   distributed streaming.  It prescribes some interesting general
   purpose features that seem to extend far beyond the simpler streaming
   model SECEVENTs is after.  A comment from MS has been that Kafka does
   an acknowledge with poll combination event which seems to be a
   performance advantage.  See: https://kafka.apache.org/intro

   Google Pub/Sub

   Google Pub Sub system favours a model whereby polling and
   acknowledgement of events is done as separate endpoints as separate
   functions.
