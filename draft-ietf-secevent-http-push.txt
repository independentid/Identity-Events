1.  Introduction and Overview

   This specification defines how SETs (see [RFC8417]) can be
   transmitted to a previously registered SET Receiver using HTTP
   [RFC7231] over TLS.  The specification defines a method to push SETs
   via HTTP POST.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   For purposes of readability examples are not URL encoded.
   Implementers MUST percent encode URLs as described in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC3986] .

   Throughout this documents all figures MAY contain spaces and extra
   line-wrapping for readability and space limitations.  Similarly, some
   URI's contained within examples, have been shortened for space and
   readability reasons.

1.2.  Definitions

   This specification assumes terminology defined in the Security Event
   Token specification[RFC8417], as well as the terms defined below:

   SET Transmitter
      A service provider that delivers SETs to other providers known as
      SET Receivers.

   SET Receiver
      A service provider that registers to receive SETs from a SET
      Transmitter and provides an endpoint to receive SETs via HTTP
      POST.

2.  Event Delivery

2.1.  Event Delivery Process

   When an Event occurs, the SET Transmitter constructs a SET token
   [RFC8417] that describes the Event.

   How SETs are defined and the process by which Events are identified
   for SET Receivers is out-of-scope of this specification.

   When a SET is available for a SET Receiver, the SET Transmitter
   attempts to deliver the SET based on the SET Receiver's registered
   delivery mechanism:

   o  The SET Transmitter uses an HTTP/1.1 POST to the SET Receiver
      endpoint to deliver the SET;




Backman, et al.          Expires March 29, 2019                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-secevent-http-push       September 2018


   o  Or, the SET Transmitter delivers the Event through a different
      method not defined by this specification.

   In Push-Based SET Delivery Using HTTP, SETs are delivered one at a
   time using HTTP POST requests by a SET Transmitter to a SET Receiver.
   The HTTP request body is a JSON Web Token [RFC7519] with a "Content-
   Type" header of "application/secevent+jwt" as defined in Section 2.2
   and 6.2 of [RFC8417].  Upon receipt, the SET Receiver acknowledges
   receipt with a response with HTTP Status 202, as described below in
   Section 2.2.

   After successful (acknowledged) SET delivery, SET Transmitters SHOULD
   NOT be required to maintain or record SETs for recovery.  Once a SET
   is acknowledged, the SET Receiver SHALL be responsible for retention
   and recovery.

   Transmitted SETs SHOULD be self-validating (e.g. signed) if there is
   a requirement to verify they were issued by the SET Transmitter at a
   later date when de-coupled from the original delivery where
   authenticity could be checked via the HTTP or TLS mutual
   authentication.

   Upon receiving a SET, the SET Receiver reads the SET and validates
   it.  The SET Receiver MUST acknowledge receipt to the SET
   Transmitter, using the defined acknowledgement or error method.

   The SET Receiver SHALL NOT use the Event acknowledgement mechanism to
   report Event errors other than relating to the parsing and validation
   of the SET.

2.2.  Push Delivery using HTTP

   This method allows a SET Transmitter to use HTTP POST (Section 4.3.3
   [RFC7231]) to deliver SETs to a previously registered web callback
   URI supplied by the SET Receiver as part of a configuration process
   (not defined by this document).

   The SET to be delivered MAY be signed and/or encrypted as defined in
   [RFC8417].

   The HTTP Content-Type (see Section 3.1.1.5 [RFC7231]) for the HTTP
   POST is "application/secevent+jwt" and SHALL consist of a single SET
   (see [RFC8417]).  As per Section 5.3.2 [RFC7231], the expected media
   type ("Accept" header) response is "application/json".

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-secevent-http-push       September 2018


   To deliver an Event, the SET Transmitter generates an event delivery
   message and uses HTTP POST to the configured endpoint with the
   appropriate "Accept" and "Content-Type" headers.

   POST /Events  HTTP/1.1

   Host: notify.examplerp.com

   .

                    Figure 1: Example HTTP POST Request

   Upon receipt of the request, the SET Receiver SHALL validate the JWT
   structure of the SET as defined in Section 7.2 [RFC7519].  The SET
   Receiver SHALL also validate the SET information as described in
   Section 2 [RFC8417].

   If the SET is determined to be valid, the SET Receiver SHALL
   "acknowledge" successful submission by responding with HTTP Status
   202 as "Accepted" (see Section 6.3.3 [RFC7231]).

   In order to maintain compatibility with other methods of
   transmission, the SET Receiver SHOULD NOT include an HTTP response
   body representation of the submitted SET or what the SET's pending
   status is when acknowledging success.  In the case of an error (e.g.
   HTTP Status 400), the purpose of the HTTP response body is to
   indicate any SET parsing, validation, or cryptographic errors.

   The following is a non-normative example of a successful receipt of a
   SET.

   HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted

              Figure 2: Example Successful Delivery Response

   Note that the purpose of the "acknowledgement" response is to let the
   SET Transmitter know that a SET has been delivered and the
   information no longer needs to be retained by the SET Transmitter.
   Before acknowledgement, SET Receivers SHOULD ensure they have
   validated received SETs and retained them in a manner appropriate to
   information retention requirements appropriate to the SET event types
   signaled.  The level and method of retention of SETs by SET Receivers
   is out-of-scope of this specification.

   In the Event of a general HTTP error condition, the SET Receiver MAY
   respond with an appropriate HTTP Status code as defined in Section 6
   [RFC7231].

   When the SET Receiver detects an error parsing or validating a
   received SET (as defined by [RFC8417]), the SET Receiver SHALL
   indicate an HTTP Status 400 error with an error response as described
   in Section 2.3.1.

   The following is an example non-normative error response.

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "err":"dup",
     "description":"SET already received. Ignored."

   }

                Figure 3: Example HTTP Status 400 Response

2.3.  Security Event Token Delivery Error Codes

   Security Event Token Delivery Error Codes are strings that identify a
   specific type of error that may occur when parsing or validating a
   SET.  Every Security Event Token Delivery Error Code MUST have a
   unique name registered in the IANA "Security Event Token Delivery
   Error Codes" registry established by Section 6.1.

   The following table presents the initial set of Error Codes that are
   registered in the IANA "Security Event Token Delivery Error Codes"
   registry:

   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Err Value | Description                                           |

   | dup       | A duplicate SET was received and has been ignored.    |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+

                     Table 1: SET Delivery Error Codes

2.3.1.  Error Response Handling

   An error response SHALL include a JSON object which provides details
   about the error.  The JSON object includes the JSON attributes:

   err
      A value which is a keyword that describes the error (see Table 1).

   description
      A human-readable text that provides additional diagnostic
      information.

   When included as part of an HTTP Status 400 response, the above JSON
   is the HTTP response body (see Figure 3).

3.  Authentication and Authorization

   The SET delivery method described in this specification is based upon
   HTTP and depends on the use of TLS and/or standard HTTP
   authentication and authorization schemes as per [RFC7235].  For
   example, the following methodologies could be used among others:

   TLS Client Authentication



Backman, et al.          Expires March 29, 2019                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-secevent-http-push       September 2018


      Event delivery endpoints MAY request TLS mutual client
      authentication.  See Section 7.3 [RFC5246].

   Bearer Tokens
      Bearer tokens [RFC6750] MAY be used when combined with TLS and a
      token framework such as OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].  For security
      considerations regarding the use of bearer tokens in SET delivery
      see Section 4.4.1.

   Basic Authentication
      Usage of basic authentication should be avoided due to its use of
      a single factor that is based upon a relatively static, symmetric
      secret.  Implementers SHOULD combine the use of basic
      authentication with other factors.  The security considerations of
      HTTP BASIC, are well documented in [RFC7617] and SHOULD be
      considered along with using signed SETs (see SET Payload
      Authentication below).

   SET Payload Authentication
      In scenarios where SETs are signed and the delivery method is HTTP
      POST (see Section 2.2), SET Receivers MAY elect to use Basic
      Authentication or not to use HTTP or TLS based authentication at
      all.  See Section 4.1 for considerations.

   As per Section 4.1 of [RFC7235], a SET delivery endpoint SHALL
   indicate supported HTTP authentication schemes via the "WWW-
   Authenticate" header.

   Because SET Delivery describes a simple function, authorization for
   the ability to pick-up or deliver SETs can be derived by considering
   the identity of the SET issuer, or via an authentication method
   above.  This specification considers authentication as a feature to
   prevent denial-of-service attacks.  Because SETs are not commands
   (see ), SET Receivers are free to ignore SETs that are not of
   interest.

   For illustrative purposes only, SET delivery examples show an OAuth2
   bearer token value [RFC6750] in the authorization header.  This is
   not intended to imply that bearer tokens are preferred.  However, the
   use of bearer tokens in the specification does reflect common
   practice.

3.1.  Use of Tokens as Authorizations

   When using bearer tokens or proof-of-possession tokens that represent
   an authorization grant such as issued by OAuth (see [RFC6749]),
   implementers SHOULD consider the type of authorization granted, any
   authorized scopes (see Section 3.3 of [RFC6749]), and the security



Backman, et al.          Expires March 29, 2019                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-secevent-http-push       September 2018


   subject(s) that SHOULD be mapped from the authorization when
   considering local access control rules.  Section 6 of the OAuth
   Assertions draft [RFC7521], documents common scenarios for
   authorization including:

   o  Clients using an assertion to authenticate and/or act on behalf of
      itself;

   o  Clients acting on behalf of a user; and,

   o  A Client acting on behalf of an anonymous user (e.g., see next
      section).

   When using OAuth authorization tokens, implementers MUST take into
   account the threats and countermeasures documented in the security
   considerations for the use of client authorizations (see Section 8 of
   [RFC7521]).  When using other token formats or frameworks,
   implementers MUST take into account similar threats and
   countermeasures, especially those documented by the relevant
   specifications.

4.  Security Considerations

4.1.  Authentication Using Signed SETs

   In scenarios where HTTP authorization or TLS mutual authentication
   are not used or are considered weak, JWS signed SETs SHOULD be used
   (see [RFC7515] and Security Considerations [RFC8417]).  This enables
   the SET Receiver to validate that the SET issuer is authorized to
   deliver SETs.

4.2.  HTTP Considerations

   SET delivery depends on the use of Hypertext Transfer Protocol and
   thus subject to the security considerations of HTTP Section 9
   [RFC7230] and its related specifications.

   As stated in Section 2.7.1 [RFC7230], an HTTP requestor MUST NOT
   generate the "userinfo" (i.e., username and password) component (and
   its "@" delimiter) when an "http" URI reference is generated with a
   message as they are now disallowed in HTTP.

4.3.  TLS Support Considerations

   SETs contain sensitive information that is considered PII (e.g.
   subject claims).  Therefore, SET Transmitters and SET Receivers MUST
   require the use of a transport-layer security mechanism.  Event
   delivery endpoints MUST support TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] and MAY support



Backman, et al.          Expires March 29, 2019                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-secevent-http-push       September 2018


   additional transport-layer mechanisms meeting its security
   requirements.  When using TLS, the client MUST perform a TLS/SSL
   server certificate check, per [RFC6125].  Implementation security
   considerations for TLS can be found in "Recommendations for Secure
   Use of TLS and DTLS" [RFC7525].

4.4.  Authorization Token Considerations

   When using authorization tokens such as those issued by OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749], implementers MUST take into account threats and
   countermeasures documented in Section 8 of [RFC7521].

4.4.1.  Bearer Token Considerations

   Due to the possibility of interception, Bearer tokens MUST be
   exchanged using TLS.

   Bearer tokens MUST have a limited lifetime that can be determined
   directly or indirectly (e.g., by checking with a validation service)
   by the service provider.  By expiring tokens, clients are forced to
   obtain a new token (which usually involves re-authentication) for
   continued authorized access.  For example, in OAuth2, a client MAY
   use OAuth token refresh to obtain a new bearer token after
   authenticating to an authorization server.  See Section 6 of
   [RFC6749].

   Implementations supporting OAuth bearer tokens need to factor in
   security considerations of this authorization method [RFC7521].
   Since security is only as good as the weakest link, implementers also
   need to consider authentication choices coupled with OAuth bearer
   tokens.  The security considerations of the default authentication
   method for OAuth bearer tokens, HTTP BASIC, are well documented in
   [RFC7617], therefore implementers are encouraged to prefer stronger
   authentication methods.  Designating the specific methods of
   authentication and authorization are out-of-scope for the delivery of
   SET tokens, however this information is provided as a resource to
   implementers.

5.  Privacy Considerations

   If a SET needs to be retained for audit purposes, JWS MAY be used to
   provide verification of its authenticity.

   When sharing personally identifiable information or information that
   is otherwise considered confidential to affected users, SET
   Transmitters and Receivers MUST have the appropriate legal agreements
   and user consent or terms of service in place.

   The propagation of subject identifiers can be perceived as personally
   identifiable information.  Where possible, SET Transmitters and
   Receivers SHOULD devise approaches that prevent propagation -- for
   example, the passing of a hash value that requires the subscriber to
   already know the subject.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Security Event Token Delivery Error Codes

   This document defines Security Event Token Delivery Error Codes, for
   which IANA is asked to create and maintain a new registry titled
   "Security Event Token Delivery Error Codes".  Initial values for the
   Security Event Token Delivery Error Codes registry are given in
   Table 1.  Future assignments are to be made through the Expert Review
   registration policy ([RFC8126]) and shall follow the template
   presented in Section 6.1.1.

6.1.1.  Registration Template

   Error Code
      The name of the Security Event Token Delivery Error Code, as
      described in Section 2.3.  The name MUST be a case-sensitive ASCII
      string consisting only of upper-case letters ("A" - "Z"), lower-
      case letters ("a" - "z"), and digits ("0" - "9").

   Description
      A brief human-readable description of the Security Event Token
      Delivery Error Code.

   Change Controller
      For error codes registered by the IETF or its working groups, list
      "IETF Secevent Working Group".  For all other error codes, list
      the name of the party responsible for the registration.  Contact
      information such as mailing address, email address, or phone
      number may also be provided.

   Defining Document(s)
      A reference to the document or documents that define the Security
      Event Token Delivery Error Code.  The definition MUST specify the
      name and description of the error code, and explain under what
      circumstances the error code may be used.  URIs that can be used
      to retrieve copies of each document at no cost SHOULD be included.

Appendix A.  Other Streaming Specifications

   [[EDITORS NOTE: This section to be removed prior to publication]]

   The following pub/sub, queuing, streaming systems were reviewed as
   possible solutions or as input to the current draft:

   XMPP Events

   The WG considered the XMPP events ands its ability to provide a
   single messaging solution without the need for both polling and push
   modes.  The feeling was the size and methodology of XMPP was to far
   apart from the current capabilities of the SECEVENTs community which
   focuses in on HTTP based service delivery and authorization.

   Amazon Simple Notification Service

   Simple Notification Service, is a pub/sub messaging product from AWS.
   SNS supports a variety of subscriber types: HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, AWS
   Lambda functions, email addresses (as JSON or plain text), phone
   numbers (via SMS), and AWS SQS standard queues.  It doesn't directly
   support pull, but subscribers can get the pull model by creating an
   SQS queue and subscribing it to the topic.  Note that this puts the
   cost of pull support back onto the subscriber, just as it is in the
   push model.  It is not clear that one way is strictly better than the
   other; larger, sophisticated developers may be happy to own message
   persistence so they can have their own internal delivery guarantees.
   The long tail of OIDC clients may not care about that, or may fail to
   get it right.  Regardless, I think we can learn something from the
   Delivery Policies supported by SNS, as well as the delivery controls
   that SQS offers (e.g.  Visibility Timeout, Dead-Letter Queues).  I'm
   not suggesting that we need all of these things in the spec, but they
   give an idea of what features people have found useful.

   Apache Kafka

   Apache Kafka is an Apache open source project based upon TCP for
   distributed streaming.  It prescribes some interesting general
   purpose features that seem to extend far beyond the simpler streaming
   model SECEVENTs is after.  A comment from MS has been that Kafka does
   an acknowledge with poll combination event which seems to be a
   performance advantage.  See: https://kafka.apache.org/intro

   Google Pub/Sub

   Google Pub Sub system favours a model whereby polling and
   acknowledgement of events is done as separate endpoints as separate
   functions.

Appendix B.  Acknowledgments

   The editors would like to thanks the members of the SCIM WG which
   began discussions of provisioning events starting with: draft-hunt-
   scim-notify-00 in 2015.

   The editors would like to thank the authors of draft-ietf-secevent-
   delivery-02, on which this draft is based.

   The editor would like to thank the participants in the the SECEVENTS
   working group for their support of this specification.

Appendix C.  Change Log

   Draft 00 - AB - Based on draft-ietf-secevent-delivery-02 with the
   following changes:

   o  Renamed to "Push-Based SET Token Delivery Using HTTP"

   o  Removed references to the HTTP Polling delivery method.

   o  Removed informative reference to RFC6202.
