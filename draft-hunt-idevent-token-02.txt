Abstract

   This specification defines an Identity Event token which may be
   distributed via a protocol such as HTTP.  An identity event token is
   based on the JSON Web Token and may be optionally signed and/or
   encrypted.  It describes a statement of fact that may be shared by an
   event publisher with registered subscribers.

1.  Introduction and Overview

   This specification defines an extensible event token format which may
   be exchanged using protocols such as HTTP.  The specification builds
   on the JSON Web Token format [RFC7519] in order to provide a self-
   contained message "token" that can be optionally signed using JSON
   Web Signature [RFC7515] and/or encrypted using JSON Web Encryption
   [RFC7516].

   For the purpose of this specification an "event" is a statement of
   fact by a publisher (also known as an issuer) that the state of a
   resource it controls has changed in some way (explicitly or
   implicitly).  A resource may be permanent (e.g. a User account) or
   temporary (e.g. a login session) in nature.  A resource state change
   may include direct changes to state or implicit changes to state or
   other higher-level security statements such as:

   o  The creation, modification, removal of a resource.

   o  The reseting or suspension of an account.

   o  The revoking of a security token before its expiry.

   o  The logout of a user session.  Or,

   o  A cumulative conclusion such as to indicate that a user has taken
      over an email identifier that may have been used in the past by
      another user.

   Based on some agreed upon criteria for an event feed, the publisher
   distributes the event to the appropriate subscribers.  While an event
   may be delivered via synchronous means (e.g.  HTTP POST), the
   distribution of the event often happens asynchronously to the
   original action which generated the event.  For example, an OAuth2
   Authorization server [RFC6749], having received an token revocation
   request [RFC7009], may issue a token revocation event to downstream
   web resource providers.  Having been informed of a token revocation,
   the resource server may add the token identifier to its local
   revocation list assuming the token has not already expired.

   A subscriber having received an event, validates and interprets the
   event and takes its own independent action, if any.  For example,
   having been informed of a personal identifier now being associated
   with a different resource (i.e. is being used by someone-else), the
   subscriber may choose to ensure that the new user is not granted
   access to resources associated with the previous user.  Or it may not
   have any relationship with the subject and no action is taken.

   While subscribers will often take actions upon receiving one or more
   events, events MUST NOT be assumed to be commands or requests.  To do
   so requires complex bi-directional signalling and error recovery
   mechanisms which fall outside the scope of this specification.  The
   intent of this specification is to define a way of exchanging
   statements of fact that subscribers may interpret for their own
   purposes.  Since Events are typically historical statements by a
   publisher and are not commands, idempotency or or lack there of, does
   not apply.

   Unless otherwise specified, this specification uses example events
   intended as non-normative examples showing how an event may be used.
   It is expected that other specifications will use this specification
   to define normative events.

   This specification is scoped to security and identity related events.
   While event tokens may be used for other purposes, the specification
   only considers security and privacy concerns relevant to identity and
   personal information.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  These

   keywords are capitalized when used to unambiguously specify
   requirements of the protocol or application features and behavior
   that affect the inter-operability and security of implementations.
   When these words are not capitalized, they are meant in their
   natural-language sense.

   For purposes of readability examples are not URL encoded.
   Implementers MUST percent encode URLs as described in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC3986].

   Throughout this documents all figures MAY contain spaces and extra
   line-wrapping for readability and space limitations.  Similarly, some
   URI's contained within examples, have been shortened for space and
   readability reasons.

1.2.  Definitions

   The following definitions are used with Identity Events:

   Feed Publisher
      The Feed Publisher provides events to be distributed to registered
      subscribers.  In JWT terminology, the Feed Publisher is also known
      as the issuer "iss").

   Event
      An event is a resource change statement that is to be distributed
      to one or more registered subscribers.  An event is constructed as
      a JWT token and MAY be signed or encrypted using JWS/JWE for
      authentication and confidentiality reasons.

   Feed
      A feed a logical grouping of events or a context under which
      events may be issued.  An interested client registers with the
      Feed Publisher to subscribe to events associated with a feed.  How
      a feed is defined or the method for subscription is out-of-scope
      of this specification.

   Subscriber
      A Subscriber registers to receive event notifications from a Feed
      Publisher using a protocol such as HTTP.  The method of
      registration and delivery is out-of-scope of this specification.

2.  Events

   An identity event conveys a message (in the form of a JWT token
   [RFC7519]) about a security subject that may be of interest to a
   subscriber or set of subscribers participating in an event feed (see
   [idevent-subscription]).

Internet-Draft          draft-hunt-idevent-token               July 2016


   In addition to the JWT attributes "iss" and "aud", an event message
   contains the attribute "events" with at least one URI value used to
   indicate what type of event has occurred and what information
   (attributes) may be present in the event token.  and what type of
   event (e.g. resource modified) is contained in the event message.

   The schema and structure of an event follows the JWT [RFC7519].  An
   event JWT has the following characteristics:

   o  a common set of attributes common to every event, and

   o  one or more event extensions that each contain a set of attributes
      that belonging to an extension.

   The following is a non-normative example showing a password change
   event that conveys a SCIM event (see [idevent-scim]):

   {
     "jti": "3d0c3cf797584bd193bd0fb1bd4e7d30",
     "events":[
       "urn:ietf:params:scim:event:passwordReset",
       "https://example.com/scim/event/password"
     ],
     "iat": 1458496025,
     "iss": "https://scim.example.com",
     "aud":[
       "https://jhub.example.com/Feeds/98d52461fa5bbc879593b7754",
       "https://jhub.example.com/Feeds/5d7604516b1d08641d7676ee7"
     ],
     "sub":
       "https://scim.example.com/Users/44f6142df96bd6ab61e7521d9",
     "urn:ietf:params:scim:event:passwordReset":{
       "id":"44f6142df96bd6ab61e7521d9",
     },
     "https://example.com/scim/event/password":{
        "resetAttempts":5
     }
   }

                Figure 1: Example SCIM Password Reset Event

   The event in the figure above expresses hypothetical password reset
   event for SCIM.  The JWT consists of:

   o  An _events_ attribute specifying the hypothetical SCIM urn for a
      password reset, an a custom extension,
      "https://example.com/scim/event/password", that is used to provide

      additional event information presumably specified by the location
      URI provided.

   o  An "iss" attribute which denotes the event publisher.

   o  The "aud" attribute specifies the intended audience for the event.
      In practical terms this MAY be the the URI for the event feed that
      a client has subscribed to.

   Additional extensions to an event may be added by adding more values
   to the "events" attribute.  For each event URI value specified, there
   MAY be a corresponding attribute that has a JSON object that contains
   the attributes associated with that event (e.g.
   "https://example.com/scim/event/password").  In this example, the
   SCIM event indicates that a password has been updated and the current
   password reset count is 5.  Notice that the value for "resetAttempts"
   is actually part of its own JSON object
   "https://example.com/scim/event/password".

   Here is another example event message, this one for a Logout Token:

   {
     "iss": "https://server.example.com",
     "aud": "s6BhdRkqt3",
     "jti": "3d0c3cf797584bd193bd0fb1bd4e7d30",
     "sub": "248289761001",
     "iat": 1458668180,
     "exp": 1458668580,
     "events": [
       "https://specs.openid.net/logout"
     ],
     "https://specs.openid.net/logout": {
       "sid": "08a5019c-17e1-4977-8f42-65a12843ea02"
     }
   }

2.1.  Core Event Attributes

   The following are attributes that are based on [RFC7519] claim
   definitions and are profiled for use in an event message:

   jti
      As defined by Section 4.1.7 [RFC7519] contains a unique identifier
      for an event.  The identifier SHOULD be unique within a particular
      event feed and MAY be used by clients to track whether a

Internet-Draft          draft-hunt-idevent-token               July 2016


      particular event has already been received.  This attribute is
      REQUIRED.

   iss
      A single valued String containing the URI of the service provider
      publishing the event (the issuer).  For example, in SCIM protocol
      [RFC7644], this is the SCIM Service Provider's root endpoint.
      This attribute is REQUIRED.

   aud
      A multi-valued String containing the URIs representing the
      audience of the event.  Values are typically URLs of the feeds the
      event is associated with.  When an event has multiple audiences
      that go to the same subscriber, the publisher is not obligated to
      deliver repeated events to the same subscriber.  This attribute is
      RECOMMENDED.

   sub
      A value that identifies the subject of the event.  This SHOULD be
      the URI of the affected resource, the "jti" of a revoked token, or
      some meaningful identifier.  Some example resources include:
      users, tokens, grants, sessions, IP addresses or any addressable
      resource about which a change in state (direct or derived) may be
      described.  This attribute is REQUIRED.

   iat
      As defined by Section 4.1.6 [RFC7519], a value containing a
      NumericDate which represents when the event was issued.  Unless
      otherwise specified, the value SHOULD be interpreted by the
      subscriber as equivalent to the actual time of the event.  This
      attribute is REQUIRED.

   nbf
      As defined by Section 4.1.5 [RFC7519], a value containing a
      NumericDate which represents a future date when the event will
      occur.  This attribute is OPTIONAL.

   The following is a new attribute defined by this specification:

   events
      A multi-valued String that contains the URIs of event types
      contained within the JWT.  Values in this attribute further
      indicate what other JSON objects are present within the parent
      JSON event structure.  Each OPTIONAL JSON sub-object is denoted by
      an attribute that matches a value in "events".  This attribute is
      REQUIRED.

2.2.  Event Token Construction

   An Event Token is a JWT [RFC7519] that is constructed by building a
   JSON structure that constitutes an event object and which is then
   used as the body of a JWT.

   While this specification uses JWT to convey an event message,
   implementers SHALL NOT use these events to convey authentication or
   authorization assertions.

   The following is an example event message(it has been modified for
   readability):

   {
     "jti": "4d3559ec67504aaba65d40b0363faad8",
     "iat": 1458496404,
     "iss": "https://scim.example.com",
     "aud":[
      "https://scim.example.com/Feeds/98d52461fa5bbc879593b7754",
      "https://scim.example.com/Feeds/5d7604516b1d08641d7676ee7"
     ],
     "sub": "https://scim.example.com/Users/44f6142df96bd6ab61e7521d9",
     "events":[
       "urn:ietf:params:scim:event:create"
     ],
     "urn:ietf:params:scim:event:create":{
       "attributes":["id","name","userName","password","emails"],
       "values":{
         "emails":[
          {"type":"work","value":"jdoe@example.com"}
         ],
         "password":"not4u2no",
         "userName":"jdoe",
         "id":"44f6142df96bd6ab61e7521d9",
         "name":{
           "givenName":"John",
           "familyName":"Doe"
         }
       }
     }
   }

                     Figure 3: Example Event JSON Data

   When transmitted, the above JSON body must be converted into a JWT as
   per [RFC7519].  In this example, because the event contains attribute
   values, the token MUST be encrypted per JWE (see [RFC7516]) before
   transmission.

   The following is an example of a SCIM Event expressed in an unsecured
   JWT token.  The JWT header of:

   Base64url encoding of the octets of the UTF-8 representation of the
   header yields:

                  Figure 4: Example Unsecured Event Token

   To create and or validate a signed or encrypted event token follow
   the instructions in section 7 of [RFC7519].

3.  Security Considerations

   Events may often contain sensitive information.  Therefore methods
   for distribution of events SHOULD require the use of a transport-
   layer security mechanism when distributing events.  Parties MUST
   support TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] and MAY support additional transport-layer
   mechanisms meeting its security requirements.  When using TLS, the
   client MUST perform a TLS/SSL server certificate check, per
   [RFC6125].  Implementation security considerations for TLS can be
   found in "Recommendations for Secure Use of TLS and DTLS" [RFC7525].

   Events distributed through third-parties or that carry personally
   identifiable information, SHOULD be encrypted using JWE [RFC7516] or
   secured for confidentiality by other means.

   Events distributed without authentication over the channel, such as
   via TLS ([RFC5246] and [RFC6125]), and/or OAuth2 [RFC6749], or Basic
   Authentication [RFC7617], MUST be signed using JWS [RFC7515] so that
   individual events MAY be authenticated and validated by the
   subscriber.

4.  Privacy Considerations

   If an event needs to be retained for audit purposes, JWS MAY be used
   to provide verification of its authenticity.

   Publishers should attempt to specialize feeds so that the content is
   targeted to the specific business and protocol needs of subscribers.

   When sharing personally identifiable information or information that
   is otherwise considered confidential to affected users, the
   publishers and subscribers MUST have the appropriate legal agreements
   and user consent in place.

   The propagation of subject identifiers can be perceived as personally
   identifiable information.  Where possible, publishers and subscribers
   should devise approaches the prevents propagation.  For example the
   passing of a hash value that requires the subscriber to already know
   the subject.

5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA requirements.
