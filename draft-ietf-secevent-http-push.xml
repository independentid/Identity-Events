        This specification defines how a stream of SETs (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-secevent-token"/>)
        can be transmitted to a previously registered 
        Event Receiver using HTTP <xref target="RFC7231"/>
        over TLS. The specification defines a method to push SETs via

      <t>This specification defines a method for SET delivery in what

              A service provider that delivers SETs to other providers known
              as Event Receivers. An Event Transmitter
              is responsible for offering a service that allows the Event
              Receiver to check the Event Stream configuration and status
              known as the "Control Plane".

              A service provider that registers to receive SETs from 
              an Event Transmitter and provides an endpoint to receive
              SETs via HTTP POST. 
              Event Receivers
              can check current Event Stream configuration and status by

            <t hangText="Event Stream"><vspace/>
              An Event Stream is a defined location, distribution method
              and whereby an Event Transmitter and Event Receiver 
              exchange a pre-defined family of SETs. A Stream is assumed
              to have configuration data such as HTTP endpoints, timeouts,
              public key sets for signing and encryption, and 
              Event Families.

              a person, an email address, a service provider entity, an
              IP address, an OAuth Client, a mobile device, or any identifiable

  <section title="SET Event Stream Protocol">
    <t>An Event Stream represents the communication channel over which a 
    series of SETs are delivered to a configured Event Receiver. </t>
    
    <section anchor="process" title="Event Delivery Process">
			<t>When an Event occurs, the Event Transmitter constructs a SET
      token <xref target="I-D.ietf-secevent-token" /> that describes the	
      Event. The Event Transmitter determines the Event Streams over which the
      SET should be distributed to.</t>
      <t> 
      How SETs are defined and the process by which Events are identified for 
      Event Receivers is out-of-scope of this	specification.
			</t>

			<t>
			When a SET is available for an Event Receiver, the Event Transmitter
			attempts to deliver the SET based on the Event Receiver's registered
			delivery mechanism:
			<list style="symbols">
				<t>The Event Transmitter uses an HTTP/1.1 POST to the Event 
        Receiver endpoint to deliver the SET;
			  </t>
			  <t>Or, the Event Transmitter delivers the Event through a different
        method not defined by this specification.
			  </t>
			</list>
			</t>
      
      <t>In Push-Based SET Delivery Using HTTP, SETs are delivered
        one at a time using HTTP POST requests by an Event Transmitter 
        to an Event Receiver. The HTTP request body is a JSON Web Token 
        <xref target="RFC7519"/> with a <spanx style="verb">Content-Type</spanx> 
        header of <spanx style="verb">application/secevent+jwt</spanx> 
        as defined in Section 2.2 and 6.2 of 
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-secevent-token"/>. Upon receipt, the 
        Event Receiver acknowledges receipt with a response with HTTP 
        Status 202, as described below in <xref target="httpPost"/>.</t>

			<t>After successful (acknowledged) SET delivery, Event 
      Transmitters SHOULD NOT be required to maintain or record SETs for 
      recovery. Once a SET is acknowledged, the Event Receiver SHALL be 
      responsible for retention and recovery.</t>
      
      <t>Transmitted SETs SHOULD be self-validating (e.g. signed)
      if there is a requirement to verify they were issued by the Event 
      Transmitter at a later date when de-coupled from the original 
      delivery where authenticity could be checked via the HTTP or 
      TLS mutual authentication.
			</t>

			<t>
			Upon receiving a SET, the Event Receiver reads the SET and validates 
      it. The Event Receiver MUST acknowledge receipt to the Event Transmitter, using the 
      defined acknowledgement or error method.</t>
      
      <t>The Event Receiver SHALL NOT use the Event acknowledgement mechanism
      to report Event errors other than relating to the parsing and validation
      of the SET.</t>

  <section anchor="httpPost" title="Push Delivery using HTTP">

     SETs to a previously registered web callback URI supplied by the
     Event Receiver as part of an Event Stream configuration process 
     (not defined by this document).</t>

     SHALL also validate the SET information as described
     in <xref target="I-D.ietf-secevent-token">Section 2</xref>.</t>

     (see <xref target="RFC7231">Section 6.3.3</xref>).</t>
     
     <t>In order
     to maintain compatibility with other methods of transmission, the 
     Event Receiver SHOULD NOT include an HTTP response body representation
     of the submitted SET or what the SET's pending status is when 
     acknowledging success. In the case of an error (e.g. HTTP Status 400),
     the purpose of the HTTP response body is to indicate any SET parsing, 
     validation, or cryptographic errors.</t>

      <t>The SET delivery method described in this specification is
      based upon HTTP and depends on the use of TLS and/or standard 
      HTTP authentication and authorization schemes as per 
      <xref target="RFC7235" />. For example, the following
      methodologies could be used among others: <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="TLS Client Authentication"><vspace />Event delivery
          endpoints MAY request TLS mutual client authentication.

          For security considerations regarding the use of bearer tokens in
          SET delivery see <xref target="bearerConsiderations" />.</t>

          <t hangText="Basic Authentication"><vspace />Usage of basic
          authentication should be avoided due to its use of a single factor
          that is based upon a relatively static, symmetric secret.
          Implementers SHOULD combine the use of basic authentication with
          other factors. The security considerations of HTTP BASIC, are well
          documented in <xref target="RFC7617" /> and SHOULD be considered
          along with using signed SETs (see SET Payload Authentication below).</t>
          
          <t hangText="SET Payload Authentication"><vspace/>In scenarios 
          where SETs are signed and
          the delivery method is HTTP POST (see <xref target="httpPost" />),
          Event Receivers MAY elect to use Basic Authentication or not 
          to use HTTP or TLS based authentication at all. See 
          <xref target="payloadAuthentication" /> for considerations.</t>

      <t>As per <xref target="RFC7235">Section 4.1 of</xref>, a SET
      delivery endpoint SHALL indicate supported HTTP authentication 
      schemes via the <spanx style="verb">WWW-Authenticate</spanx> header.</t>

      <t>Because SET Delivery describes a simple function, authorization
      for the ability to pick-up or deliver SETs can be derived by
      considering the identity of the SET issuer, or via an authentication
      method above. This specification considers authentication as a
      feature to prevent denial-of-service attacks. Because SETs are
      not commands (see ), Event Receivers are free to ignore SETs that 
      are not of interest.</t>

      <t>For illustrative purposes only, SET delivery examples show an OAuth2
      bearer token value <xref target="RFC6750" /> in the authorization header.
      This is not intended to imply that bearer tokens are
      preferred. However, the use of bearer tokens in the specification does
      reflect common practice. </t>

      <section anchor="authzTokens" title="Use of Tokens as Authorizations">
        <t>When using bearer tokens or proof-of-possession tokens that
        represent an authorization grant such as issued by OAuth (see <xref target="RFC6749" />), implementers SHOULD consider the type of
        authorization granted, any authorized scopes (see Section 3.3 of <xref target="RFC6749" />), and the security subject(s) that SHOULD be mapped
        from the authorization when considering local access control rules.
        Section 6 of the OAuth Assertions draft <xref target="RFC7521" />, documents common scenarios for

        security considerations for the use of client authorizations (see
        Section 8 of <xref target="RFC7521" />). When using

      <section anchor="payloadAuthentication" title="Authentication Using Signed SETs">
      <t>In scenarios where HTTP authorization or TLS mutual authentication
      are not used or are considered weak, JWS signed SETs SHOULD be 
      used (see <xref target="RFC7515"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-secevent-token">
      Security Considerations</xref>). This enables the Event Receiver
      to validate that the SET issuer is authorized to deliver SETs.
      </t>
      </section>
      <section title="HTTP Considerations">
        <t>SET delivery depends on the use of Hypertext Transfer Protocol and thus
        subject to the security considerations of HTTP <xref
        target="RFC7230">Section 9</xref> and its related specifications.</t>

        <t>As stated in <xref target="RFC7230">Section 2.7.1</xref>, an 
        HTTP requestor MUST NOT generate the <spanx style="verb">userinfo</spanx>
        (i.e., username and password) component (and its "@" delimiter) when
        an "http" URI reference is generated with a message as they are now
        disallowed in HTTP.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="TLS Support Considerations">
        <t>SETs contain sensitive information that is considered PII
        (e.g. subject claims). Therefore, Event Transmitters and
        Event Receivers MUST require the use of a transport-layer 
        security mechanism. Event delivery endpoints MUST support TLS 
        1.2 <xref target="RFC5246"/> and MAY support additional 
        transport-layer mechanisms meeting its security requirements. 
        When using TLS, the client MUST perform a TLS/SSL server
        certificate check, per <xref target="RFC6125"/>. Implementation
        security considerations for TLS can be found in "Recommendations for
        Secure Use of TLS and DTLS" <xref target="RFC7525"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Authorization Token Considerations">
        <t>When using authorization tokens such as those issued by OAuth 2.0
        <xref target="RFC6749"/>, implementers MUST take into account threats
        and countermeasures documented in Section 8 of <xref
        target="RFC7521"/>.</t>
        
        <section anchor="bearerConsiderations"
               title="Bearer Token Considerations">
        <t>Due to the possibility of interception, Bearer tokens MUST be 
        exchanged using TLS.</t>

        <t>Bearer tokens MUST have a limited lifetime that can be determined
        directly or indirectly (e.g., by checking with a validation service)
        by the service provider. By expiring tokens, clients are forced to
        obtain a new token (which usually involves re-authentication) for
        continued authorized access. For example, in OAuth2, a client MAY use
        OAuth token refresh to obtain a new bearer token after authenticating
        to an authorization server. See Section 6 of <xref
        target="RFC6749"/>.</t>

        <t>Implementations supporting OAuth bearer tokens need to factor in
        security considerations of this authorization method <xref
        target="RFC7521"/>. Since security is only as good
        as the weakest link, implementers also need to consider authentication
        choices coupled with OAuth bearer tokens. The security considerations
        of the default authentication method for OAuth bearer tokens, HTTP
        BASIC, are well documented in <xref
        target="RFC7617"/>, therefore implementers
        are encouraged to prefer stronger authentication methods. Designating
        the specific methods of authentication and authorization are
        out-of-scope for the delivery of SET tokens, however this 
        information is provided as a resource to implementers.</t>

   <section title="Privacy Considerations">
   
      <t>If a SET needs to be retained for audit purposes, JWS MAY 
      be used to provide verification of its authenticity.</t>
      
      <t>Event Transmitters SHOULD attempt to specialize Event Streams 
      so that the content is targeted to the specific business and 
      protocol needs of subscribers.</t>
      
      <t>When sharing personally identifiable information or information
      that is otherwise considered confidential to affected users, Event 
      Transmitters and Receivers MUST have the appropriate legal agreements
      and user consent or terms of service in place.</t>
      
      <t>The propagation of subject identifiers can be perceived as personally
      identifiable information. Where possible, Event Transmitters and Receivers
      SHOULD devise approaches that prevent propagation -- for example, the
      passing of a hash value that requires the subscriber to already know
      the subject.</t>

    <section title="Other Streaming Specifications">
    <t>[[EDITORS NOTE: This section to be removed prior to publication]]</t>
    
    <t>The following pub/sub, queuing, streaming systems were reviewed 
    as possible solutions or as input to the current draft:</t>
    
    <t>XMPP Events</t>
    <t>The WG considered the XMPP events ands its ability to provide a single
    messaging solution without the need for both polling and push modes.
    The feeling was the size and methodology of XMPP was to far apart from
    the current capabilities of the SECEVENTs community which focuses in
    on HTTP based service delivery and authorization.</t>
    
    <t>Amazon Simple Notification Service</t>
    <t>Simple Notification Service, is a pub/sub messaging product from 
    AWS. SNS supports a variety of subscriber types: HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, 
    AWS Lambda functions, email addresses (as JSON or plain text), phone 
    numbers (via SMS), and AWS SQS standard queues. It doesn’t directly 
    support pull, but subscribers can get the pull model by creating an 
    SQS queue and subscribing it to the topic. Note that this puts the 
    cost of pull support back onto the subscriber, just as it is in the 
    push model. It is not clear that one way is strictly better than the 
    other; larger, sophisticated developers may be happy to own message 
    persistence so they can have their own internal delivery guarantees. 
    The long tail of OIDC clients may not care about that, or may fail 
    to get it right. Regardless, I think we can learn something from the 
    Delivery Policies supported by SNS, as well as the delivery controls 
    that SQS offers (e.g. Visibility Timeout, Dead-Letter Queues). I’m 
    not suggesting that we need all of these things in the spec, but 
    they give an idea of what features people have found useful.</t>

    </list></t>
    
    <t>Apache Kafka</t>
    <t>Apache Kafka is an Apache open source project based upon TCP for 
    distributed streaming. It prescribes some interesting general 
    purpose features that seem to extend far beyond the simpler 
    streaming model SECEVENTs is after. A comment from MS has been that 
    Kafka does an acknowledge with poll combination event which seems 
    to be a performance advantage. See: https://kafka.apache.org/intro</t>
    
    <t>Google Pub/Sub</t>
    <t>Google Pub Sub system favours a model whereby polling and acknowledgement
    of events is done as separate endpoints as separate functions.</t>
