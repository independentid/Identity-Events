1.  Introduction and Overview

   This specification defines a "Control Plane" service that defines how
   an Event Receiver or its agent may provision, monitor, and manage the
   configuration of a Stream that delivers Security Event Tokens (see
   [I-D.ietf-secevent-token]) using delivery methods such as specified
   in the SET Delivery Using HTTP Specification (see
   [I-D.ietf-secevent-delivery]).

   The specification defines the metadata the Event Transmitter uses to
   describe the HTTP service endpoints, method, optional signing and
   encryption modes, and the type and contents of SETs delivered over
   the Stream.  The specification defines how the Event Receiver may

Internet-Draft      draft-hunt-secevent-distribution         August 2017


   review and update the current configuration and confirm operational
   delivery status using HTTP over TLS.

   This specification uses a limited profile of SCIM (see [RFC7643] and
   [RFC7644]).  While the full specification is not required (that is,
   support for Users and Groups), this specification does leverage the
   protocol and schema mechanism to ease adaptability to different
   underlying data systems and SET profile types.  In particular,
   Section 2 [RFC7643] SHALL provide the processing rules that enable
   Control Plane providers and clients negotiate specific attributes
   (metadata) and resource types.  This includes differing provider
   definitions of attribute types, mutability, cardinality, or
   returnability that MAY differ between deployments and SET Event type
   profiles.  For HTTP method handling and error signaling, the
   processing rules in [RFC7644] SHALL be applied.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] . These
   keywords are capitalized when used to unambiguously specify
   requirements of the protocol or application features and behavior
   that affect the inter-operability and security of implementations.
   When these words are not capitalized, they are meant in their
   natural-language sense.

   For purposes of readability examples are not URL encoded.
   Implementers MUST percent encode URLs as described in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC3986] .

   Throughout this documents all figures MAY contain spaces and extra
   line-wrapping for readability and space limitations.  Similarly, some
   URI's contained within examples, have been shortened for space and
   readability reasons.

1.2.  Definitions

   This specification assumes terminology defined in the Security Event
   Token specification [I-D.ietf-secevent-token] and SET Token Delivery
   specification [I-D.ietf-secevent-delivery].

   The following definitions are defined for Security Event
   distribution:

   Control Plane
      A Control Plane represents an service offered by an Event
      Transmitter that lets an Event Receiver query the current



Hunt, et al.            Expires February 26, 2018               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft      draft-hunt-secevent-distribution         August 2017


      operational and/or error status of an Event Stream.  The Control
      Plane MAY also be used to retrieve Event Stream and SET
      configuration data.

   Data Plane
      The Data Plane represents the HTTP service offered by an Event
      Receiver that allows the Event Transmitter to deliver multiple
      SETs via HTTP POST as part of an Event Stream.

2.  Stream Monitoring and Configuration Retrieval

   The Control Plane is an HTTP service associated with an Event
   Transmitter that enables the provisioning, and monitoring of Event
   Streams by entities such Event Receivers, administrators, and
   monitoring services.  This section describes required functionality
   to enable Event Receivers to retrieve configuration attributes and to
   detect SET delivery problems that may occur when an Event Transmitter
   fails to deliver SETs.

   This specification also defines optional Control Plane services to
   create and update streams in the next section (see Section 3).

2.1.  Event Stream Configuration Attributes

   An Event Stream is defined by a set of attributes which together
   define an Event Stream's operational configuration:

   eventUris
      An array of JSON String values which are the URIs of events issued
      in this Stream.

   methodUri
      A REQUIRED JSON String value which is a URI with a prefix of
      "urn:ietf:params:set:method".  This specification defines HTTP
      POST delivery method:
      "urn:ietf:params:set:method:HTTP:webCallback"
      in which the Feed Provider delivers events using HTTP POST to a
      specified callback URI.

   deliveryUri
      A JSON String value containing a URI that describes the location
      where SETs are received (e.g. via HTTP POST).  Its format and
      usage requirements are defined by the associated "methodUri".

   iss
      The URI for the publisher of the SETs that will be issued for the
      Event Stream.  See Section 2.1 [I-D.ietf-secevent-token].

Internet-Draft      draft-hunt-secevent-distribution         August 2017


   aud
      An OPTIONAL JSON Array of JSON String values which are URIs
      representing the audience(s) of the Event Stream.  The value SHALL
      be the value of SET "aud" claim sent to the Event Receiver.

   iss_jwksUri
      An OPTIONAL String that contains the URL of the SET issuers public
      JSON Web Key Set [RFC7517].  This contains the signing key(s) the
      Event Receiver uses to validate SET signatures from the Event
      Transmitter that will be used by the Event Receiver to verify the
      authenticity of issued SETs.

   aud_jwksUri
      An OPTIONAL JSON Web Key Set [RFC7517] that contains the Event
      Receiver's encryption keys that MAY be used by the Event
      Transmitter to encrypt SET tokens for the specified Event
      Receiver.

   status
      An OPTIONAL JSON String keyword that indicates the current state
      of an Event Stream.  More information on the Event Stream state
      can be found in Section 2.3.  Valid keywords are:

         "on" - indicates the Event Stream has been verified and that
         the Feed Provider MAY pass SETs to the Event Receiver.

         "paused" - indicates the Event Stream is temporarily suspended.
         While "paused", SETs SHOULD be retained and delivered when
         state returns to "on".  If delivery is paused for an extended
         period defined by the Event Transmitter, the Event Transmitter
         MAY change the state to "off" indicating SETs are no longer
         retained.

         "off" - indicates that the Event Stream is no longer passing
         SETs.  While in off mode, the Event Stream configuration is
         maintained, but new events are ignored, not delivered or
         retained.  Before returning to "on", a verification MUST be
         performed.

         "fail" - indicates that the Event Stream was unable to deliver
         SETs to the Event Receiver due an unrecoverable error or for an
         extended period of time.  Unlike paused status, a failed Event
         Stream does not retain existing or new SETs that are issued.
         Before returning to "on", a verification MUST be performed.

   maxRetries
      An OPTIONAL JSON number indicating the maximum number of attempts
      to deliver a SET.  A value of '0' indicates there is no maximum.



Hunt, et al.            Expires February 26, 2018               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      draft-hunt-secevent-distribution         August 2017


      Upon reaching the maximum, the Event Stream "status" attribute is
      set to "failed".

   maxDeliveryTime
      An OPTIONAL number indicating the maximum amount of time in
      seconds a SET MAY take for successful delivery per request or
      cumulatively across multiple retries.  Upon reaching the maximum,
      the Event Stream "status" is set to "failed".  If undefined, there
      is no maximum time.

   minDeliveryInterval
      An OPTIONAL JSON integer that represents the minimum interval in
      seconds between deliveries.  A value of '0' indicates delivery
      should happen immediately.  When delivery is a polling method
      (e.g.  HTTP GET), it is the expected time between Event Receiver
      attempts.  When in push mode (e.g.  HTTP POST), it is the interval
      the server will wait before sending a new event or events.

   txErr
      An OPTIONAL JSON String keyword value.  When the Event Stream has
      "subState" set to "fail", one of the following error keywords is
      set:

         "connection" indicates an error occurred attempting to open a
         TCP connection with the assigned endpoint.

         "tls" indicates an error occurred establishing a TLS connection
         with the assigned endpoint.

         "dnsname" indicates an error occurred establishing a TLS
         connection where the dnsname was not validated.

         "receiver" indicates an error occurred whereby the Event
         Receiver has indicated an error for which the Event Transmitter
         is unable to correct.

   txErrDesc
      An OPTIONAL String value that is usually human readable that
      provides further diagnostic detail by the indicated "txErr" error
      code.

   subscribers
      An OPTIONAL complex attribute containing sub objects whose sub-
      attributes define subjects against which SETs may be issued.  The
      following sub-attributes are defined:






Hunt, et al.            Expires February 26, 2018               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      draft-hunt-secevent-distribution         August 2017


      value  A String which uniquely identifies a subject (or set of
         subjects) to be included in the Stream.  The format and type of
         value is defined by the 'type' sub-attribute.

      iss  A String which contains the URI of the issuer of the subject
         identified in the "value" attribute.  When not supplied the
         issuer is assumed to be the Event Stream issuer.

      type  A case-insensitive canonical String value which defines the
         contents of the attribute 'value'.  Valid type values are:

         OIDC  Is a String value corresponding to an OpenID Connect
            subject.  The corresponding "iss" attribute is set with the
            OpenId Connect iss value.

         SAML  A String value that is a URI that represents the subject
            of a SAML Identity Provider.

         EMAIL  A String Value that is the Email addresses for a
            subject.  The value SHOULD be specified according to
            [RFC5321].

         PHIONE  Phone numbers for the user.  The value SHOULD be
            specified according to the format defined in [RFC3966],
            e.g., 'tel:+1-201-555-0123'.

         User  A SCIM User where value is the 'id' of a User resource in
            the local SCIM service provider.

         Group  A SCIM Group where the value is the 'id' of a Group
            resource in the local SCIM service provider.

         URI  A miscellaneous subject that can be identified by a URI.

   Additional Event Stream configuration (attributes) MAY be defined as
   extensions.  The method for adding new attributes is defined in
   Section 3.3 [RFC7643].

2.2.  Checking Stream Configuration and Stream State

   An Event Receiver MAY check the current status of a Stream with the
   Event Transmitter, by performing an HTTP GET using the provided URI
   from the Transmitter either through an administrative process or via
   the optional Stream creation response defined in Section 3.1.

   The format of the Stream GET request and response is defined by
   Section 3.4 [RFC7644].

Internet-Draft      draft-hunt-secevent-distribution         August 2017


   In addition to the basic attributes defined in Section 2 [RFC7643]
   common to all resource types, Streams use the attributes defined in
   Section 2.1.  In particular, the Stream configuration includes JSON
   attributes "schemas" and "id".

   schemas
      Is an array of Strings with at least a single value of
      "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:event:2.0:EventStream".

   id
      Is a String which is a permanent unique identifier for the Stream.
      The value which is also used to define the Stream Resource URI is
      permanent and provides referential integrity over time as it SHALL
      NOT change.

   These attributes are provided to enable SCIM client compatibility and
   informs the client of the type of JSON object being returned.
   Service providers may offer additional attributes by adding
   additional schema values as per [RFC7644].

   The example below retrieves a specific "EventStream" resource whose
   "id" is "548b7c3f77c8bab33a4fef40".

   }

                   Figure 2: Example Stream GET Response

   In the above figure, the Event Stream is showing a failed status due
   to a TCP connection error.  The Event Receiver is able to discover
   that its endpoint was unavailable and has been marked failed by the
   Event Transmitter.  Typically, with this type of error, appropriate
   operations staff would be alerted and some corrective action would be
   taken to check for a configuration error or service outage..

   The frequency with which Event Receivers poll the Event Stream status
   depends on the following factors:

   o  The level of technical fault tolerance and availability of the
      receiving endpoint.

   o  A frequency appropriate to the amount of risk that can be
      tolerated for lost events.  For example, if Security Events are
      considered informational, then infrequent (hourly or daily) may be
      sufficient.

Internet-Draft      draft-hunt-secevent-distribution         August 2017


   In most cases Event Stream status monitoring can be triggered on a
   timeout basis.  Event Receivers would typically poll if they have not
   received a SET for some period during which SETs would be expected
   based on past experience.

   Receivers MAY use the resource type endpoint "EventStreams" to
   retrieve available Streams based on the provided "Authorization"
   header.

   The example below retrieves any "EventStream" resources based solely
   on the requestor's authorization header.

2.3.  Event Stream State Model

   The Event Stream configuration attribute "status" reports the state
   of an Event Stream with regards to whether the stream is operational
   or is in a suspended or failed state.  Additionally, the "stream"
   attribute can be used to pause or stop streams using the stream
   configuration update functions described in Section 3.

   The following is the state machine representation of a Event Stream
   on a Event Transmitter.  Note that a Event Stream cannot be made
   active until a verification process has been completed.  As such, a
   newly created Event Stream begins with state "verify".

            Figure 5: Event Stream States at Event Transmitter

   In Figure 5, the following actions impact the operational state of an
   Event Stream. "status" values are shown in the boxes, and change
   based on the following actions:

   Create
      A Event Receiver or an administrator creates a new Event Stream
      using SCIM as described in Section 3.1.  The initial state is
      "verify".

   Error
      An Event Transmitter that has not been able to deliver a SET over
      one or more retries which has reached a limit of attempts
      ("maxRetries") or time ("maxDeliveryTime") MAY set the Event
      Stream state to "fail".  What stream status is set to "failed",
      the Event Transmitter is indicating that SETs are being lost and
      may not be recoverable.

   Limited
      A paused Event Stream has reached the transmitters ability to
      retain SETs for delivery.  The Event Transmitter changes the state
      to "off" indicating SET loss is potentially occurring.

   Restart
      An administrator having corrected the failed delivery condition
      modifies the Event Stream state to "on" (e.g. see Section 3.2).

Internet-Draft      draft-hunt-secevent-distribution         August 2017


   Suspend and Resume
      An Event Stream MAY be suspended and resumed by updating the Event
      Stream state to "paused" or "on".  For example, see see
      Section 3.2.  While suspended, the Event Transmitter retains
      undelivered SETs for a period of time and resources specified by
      the Event Transmitter (see "Limited").

   Enable and Disable
      A Event Stream MAY be disabled and enabled by updating the Event
      Stream "state" to "off" or "on".  For example, see see
      Section 3.2.  While the Event Stream is disabled, all SETs that
      occur at the Event Transmitter are lost.

3.  Stream Management and Provisioning

   This section describes optional Stream management provisioning
   features that allow receivers or provisioning systems to create
   streams and update configuration to perform actions such as rotation,
   and operational state (e.g. suspend, stop, or resume) management.

   The operations specified in this section are based on [RFC7644].  As
   such, extension declarations for Event Streams are defined in
   Appendix A.  Basic processing rules are provided by [RFC7644] along
   with additional profiling specific to the needs for Stream
   management.

3.1.  Creating An Event Stream

   To define an Event Stream, the Event Receiver or its administrator
   (known as the 'client') first obtains an authorization credential
   allowing the ability to define a new Stream.  Note: the process for
   registering to obtain credentials and permission to register is out-
   of-scope of this specification.

   Upon obtaining authorization, the client issues an HTTP POST request
   as defined in Section 3.3 [RFC7644].  To complete the request, the
   administrative entity provides the required Stream configuration
   attributes as specified in Section 2.1, the delivery method
   [I-D.ietf-secevent-delivery] and any additional configuration
   specified by the SET Event Specifications that are being used.

   The client MAY discover the Event Transmitter's Control Plane service
   for the schema requirement for an "EventStream" resource type using
   service configuration and schema discovery of Section 4 [RFC7644].

   The process to create an Event Stream is as follows:





Hunt, et al.            Expires February 26, 2018              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft      draft-hunt-secevent-distribution         August 2017


   1.  The client initiates an HTTP POST to the Control Plane endpoint
       and provides a JSON document defining an EventStream which
       contains information about the Event Receivers endpoints,
       settings, and keys.

   2.  Upon validating the request, the Event Transmitters control plane
       provisions the stream and updates the EventStream configuration
       with the corresponding Event Transmitter information.

   3.  The Control Plane responds to the request from step 1 and returns
       the final representation of the Event Stream configuration along
       with a pointer to the created EventStream resource that the
       client MAY use to monitor status and update configuration.

   4.  Upon receiving the response, the client completes the client side
       configuration and provisioning based upon the returned
       EventStream configuration.

   In the following non-normative example, a request to create a new
   "EventStream" is submitted.

   POST /EventStreams
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/scim+json
   Content-Type: application/scim+json

   In following non-normative response, the Control Plane provider has
   automatically assigned an HTTP addressable location for the
   EventStream resource as well as an "id".  Additionally, the Control
   Plane response below includes additional configuration data for "iss"
   and "iss_jwksUri".

3.2.  Updating An Event Stream

   Two HTTP methods are available to update an Event Stream
   configuration.

      The HTTP PUT operation accepts a JSON Document representing an
      existing EventStream configuration and replaces it.

      An optional HTTP PATCH operation uses a JSON Patch [RFC6902] style
      request format to allow manipulation of specific EventStream
      configuration such as (but not limited to) "status", and
      "subscribers".

Internet-Draft      draft-hunt-secevent-distribution         August 2017


3.2.1.  Update using HTTP PUT

   The HTTP PUT method allows a client having previously received the
   EventStream JSON document to modify the document and replace the
   Control Plane provider's copy.  In using this method, the client is
   not required to remove data normally asserted or defined by the Event
   Stream Control Plane provider.  The robust processing rules of
   [RFC7644] enable the client to "put back" what was previously
   received allowing the Control Plane to figure out what needs to be
   updated and ignored.  For example, while "id" is immutable, the
   Control Plane provider will simply ignore attempts to replace its
   value.

   In the following non-normative example, a request to replace the
   existing EventStream "EventStream" is submitted.  In this example,
   the change shown is the status is now set to "off".

   PUT /EventStreams/767aad7853d240debc8e3c962051c1c0
   Host: example.com

3.2.2.  Update using HTTP PATCH

   Periodically, Event Receivers MAY have need to update an EventStream
   configuration for the purpose of:

   o  Rotating access credentials or keys

   o  Updating endpoint configuration

   o  Making operational changes such as pausing, resetting, or
      disabling an Event Stream.

   o  Other operations (e.g. such as adding or removing subjects) as
      defined by profiling Event specifications.

   As documented in Section 3.5.2 [RFC7644], one or more JSON Patch
   style (see [RFC6902]) operations can be made against a single
   EventStream resource.  The update is expressed as a JSON document.




Hunt, et al.            Expires February 26, 2018              [Page 17]

Internet-Draft      draft-hunt-secevent-distribution         August 2017


   The JSON document contains an attribute "Operations" which contains
   an array of JSON objects which each have the following attributes:

   op A JSON attribute whose value is one of "add", "remove", or
      "replace".

   path  A JSON attribute whose value is a document attribute path (see
      Section 3.5.2 [RFC7644]) describing the attribute or sub-attribute
      or value to be updated in the case of multi-valued complex
      attributes such as "subscribers".

   value  The value to be assigned to the JSON document attribute
      defined in "path".

   In the following non-normative example, the client is requesting that
   "status" be changed to "paused" for the EventStream whose path is
   identified by the request URI path.

   PATCH /EventStreams/767aad7853d240debc8e3c962051c1c0
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/scim+json
   Content-Type: application/scim+json
   Authorization: Bearer h480djs93hd8

   {
     "schemas":
       ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],
     "Operations": [{
       "op":"replace",
       "path":"status",
       "value":"paused"
     }]
   }

   Upon receiving the request, the Event Transmitter would stop sending
   Events to the Receiver.  Note that while the request MAY seem complex
   it avoids the need for the requestor to have all of the current
   EventStream values in order to make a PUT request.  In other words,
   an HTTP PATCH can be typically done in a single request response
   whereas an HTTP POST usually is preceded by an HTTP GET.

   In the following non-normative example, the client is request the
   addition and removal of two subjects from an existing EventStream.

   PATCH /EventStreams/767aad7853d240debc8e3c962051c1c0
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/scim+json
   Content-Type: application/scim+json
   Authorization: Bearer h480djs93hd8

   {
     "schemas":
       ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"],
     "Operations": [{
       "op":"add",
       "path":"subscribers",
       "value":{
         "type":"EMAIL",
         "value":"alice@example.com"
       }
     },
     {
       "op":remove",
       "path":"subscribers[value eq \"bob@example.com\"]
     }]
   }

   In the above request, the remove operation uses a value filter which
   provides a matching expression against one or more sub-attributes of
   a parent attributes (subscribers).  In this case the composite value
   of subscribers which contains the sub-attribute "type" and "value"
   attribute is removed based on matching the "value" sub-attribute.
   Upon receiving the request, the EventStream subscribers attribute
   would be updated to reflect the changes.

4.  Managing Stream Subjects

   This section describes possible methods based on [RFC7644] that the
   subjects that are part of a stream can be queried and managed.  This
   section describes a few possible techniques of many that are possible
   for drafts that profile the Security Event Token specification
   [I-D.ietf-secevent-token] to handle subject management.  In this
   section, examples are given using the "subject" attribute of Event
   Stream configuration described in Section 2.1

Internet-Draft      draft-hunt-secevent-distribution         August 2017


4.1.  Considerations for Managing Subjects

   It is expected, but not required, that most deployments will not
   allow the subjects that are part of an Event Stream to be enumerated.
   In practice, the Event Stream configuration attribute "subscriber" is
   typically not returned when querying Event Stream configurations (see
   Section 2.2).  This is because the number of values may be too large
   (e.g. great than 100k values or even in the billions or more).
   Further, depending on the Security Event types being exchanged, Event
   Receivers MAY confirm that a subject is part of a stream for privacy
   reasons.

   The ability to return attributes such as "subscribers" is indicated
   by Control Plane service providers in schema discovery (see Section 4
   [RFC7644]) as the schema attribute "returned".  For "subscribers"
   this attribute SHOULD be set to "request" or "never".  In "request"
   mode, the client must specifically request the attribute
   "subscribers" to have it enumerated.  If the mode is _never_, the
   attribute SHALL NOT be returned to clients.  In all cases however, a
   client MAY execute a query to verify the presence of a subscriber:

4.2.  Checking Subscriber Membership

4.2.1.  Email Based Subjects

   In this section, values have been added to the "subject" attribute
   are email addresses which clients to the Control Plane would like to
   verify are present.  The values "subject" have sub-attribute "type"
   set to "EMAIL" and the sub-attribute "value" contains an email
   address.

   In the following non-normative example, a client queries the Control
   Plane to see if Alice@example.com is part of any defined stream
   configuration.  In the request, only the attribute "id" is requested
   as the client does not need to see the rest of the configuration.
   Note, for readability, the URL is not encoded.

GET /EventStreams?filter=(subscribers.value eq "alice@example.com")&attributes=id
Host: example.com
Accept: application/scim+json
Authorization: Bearer h480djs93hd8

   In this non-normative response, the subject is confirmed as not part
   of any Event Streams associated with the requestor.  In this case an
   empty list is returned with no values and "totalResults" is "0".

4.2.2.  OIDC Based Subjects

   In this section, values have been added to the "subject" attribute
   are OIDC users which clients to the Control Plane would like to
   verify are present.  The values "subject" have sub-attribute "type"
   set to "OIDC" and the sub-attribute "value" contains an OIDC "sub"
   value and the "iss" sub-attribute contains the corresponding OIDC
   Provider "iss" value.  For this example, the OIDC "iss" is
   "op.example.com" and the "sub" is "123456".

   In the following non-normative example, a client queries the Control
   Plane to see if the above OIDC user is part of any defined stream
   configuration.  In the request, only the attribute "id" is requested
   as the client does not need to see the rest of the configuration.
   Note, for readability, the URL is not encoded.

   GET /EventStreams?filter=(subscribers[value eq "123456" and
     iss eq "op.example.com"])&attributes=id

      Figure 15: Determining if an OIDC Subject is in an Event Stream
                                  Example

   In the above request note that "type" and "value" are enclosed within
   square brackets.  This is done, per [RFC7644] to ensure the matching
   condition within "[" and "]" is matched against the same value
   record.  If the filter was expressed as "(subscribers.value eq
   "123456" and subscribers.iss eq "op.example.com")" Then an improper
   match can occur because a composite value of "subjects" may have
   "123456" while another has "op.example.com".

   For examples of responses to Figure 15, see Figure 13 and Figure 14

4.3.  Adding and Removing Subjects to a Stream

   Adding and removing subjects to an Event Stream is performed using
   the HTTP PATCH method described in Section 3.2.2.  The following
   provides examples of adding and removing subjects based on EMAIL and
   OIDC subects.

5.  Event Stream Verification

   In the verify process, the Event Receiver organization initiates a
   request to the Event Transmitter to verify the Stream.  The Event
   Receiver provides a "confirm" value and a "nonce" value that the
   Event Transmitter is expected to return in the body of a Verify Event
   so that the Event Receiver can confirm end-to-end configuration of
   SET delivery including proper signing and encryption depending on the
   configuration of the Stream.  For example, can the Event Transmitter
   send a encrypted SET that the Receiver can decode?  The method by
   which this is initiated is out-of-scope of this specification and MAY
   be provided by a profiling specification, or by administrative
   interfaces offered by the Event Transmitter.

   To confirm an Event Stream configuration, the Event Transmitter SHALL
   send a Verify SET to the Event Receiver using the registered
   "methodUri" mechanism.

   The Verify SET contains the following attributes:

   events
      Set with a value of "[[this RFC URL]]#verify".

   iss
      Set to the URI defined in the Event Stream configuration.

   aud
      MUST be set to a value that matches the EventStream "aud" value
      agreed to.

   exp
      A value that indicates the time the verification request will
      expire.  Once expired, the server will set the Event Stream state
      to "fail".

   confirm
      The value given by the Event Receiver to the Event Transmitter to
      return in the Verify Event.

   nonce
      A value given by the Event Receiver or otherwise agreed up to
      return which SHOULD be unique to the Stream and SHOULD change with
      each test in order to distinguish tests uniquely.

   If the Event Stream is configured to encrypt SETs for the Event
   Receiver, then the SET SHOULD be encrypted with the provided key.
   Successful parsing of the message confirms that provides confirmation
   of correct configuration and possession of keys.

   A non-normative JSON representation of an Event to be sent to a Event
   Receiver as a Event Stream confirmation.  Note the Event is not yet
   encoded as a JWT token:

   {
     "jti": "4d3559ec67504aaba65d40b0363faad8",
     "events":["[[this RFC URL]]#verify"],
     "iat": 1458496404,
     "iss": "https://scim.example.com",
     "exp": 1458497000,
     "aud":[
      "https://event.example.com/Feeds/98d52461fa5bbc879593b7754"
     ],
     "[[this RFC URL]]#verify":{
       "confirm":"ca2179f4-8936-479a-a76d-5486e2baacd7",
       "nonce":"1668c993e95849869e4b3506cccdf9bf"
     }
   }

            Figure 19: Example Verification SET with Challenge

   The above SET is encoded as a JWT and transmitted to the Event
   Receiver using the configured delivery method.

   Upon receiving a verify SET, the Event Receiver SHALL parse the SET
   and verify its claims.  In particular, the Event Receiver SHALL
   confirm that the values for "confirm" and "nonce" are as expected.
   If they do not match, an error response of "setData" SHOULD be
   returned [[TO BE UPDATED]].

   In many cases, Event Transmitters MAY disable or suspend an Event
   Stream that fails to successfully verify based on the acknowledgement
   or lack of acknowledgement by the Event Receiver.

Appendix A.  Event Stream Resource Type Definition

   The "EventStream" resource type definition is defined as follows:

{
  "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:ResourceType"],
  "id": "EventStream",
  "name": "EventStream",
  "endpoint": "/EventStreams",
  "description": "Endpoint and event configuration and status for SEC EVENT streams.",
  "schema": "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:event:2.0:EventStream",
  "schemaExtensions": []
}

   The resource type above is discoverable in the "/ResourceTypes"
   endpoint of a SCIM service provider and informs SCIM clients about
   the endpoint location of EventStream resources and the SCIM schema
   used to define the resource.  The corresponding schema for the
   EventStream resource MAY be retrieved from the SCIM "/Schemas"
   endpoint (see Section 3.2 [RFC7644]).

           Figure 20: SCIM EventStream Resource Type Definition

   The attributes for the EventStream resource type are defined in
   Section 2.1.
