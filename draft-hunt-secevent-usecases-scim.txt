1.  Introduction and Overview

   SCIM is a extensible data format based on JSON [RFC7643] and a
   profile of HTTP protocol [RFC7644] intended for provisioning
   identities and other objects across security domains such as
   enterprise user and customers to a cloud based service providers.
   Service providers could be applications supporting the SCIM HTTP
   profile or may be a service provider directory upon which
   applications are integrated.

   This document defines the operational requirements SCIM deployers
   have for the use of triggers, as defined in the SCIM Use Cases
   specification [RFC7642], and used in the form of security events and
   the requirements for management based on SCIM architectural
   assumptions.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] . These
   keywords are capitalized when used to unambiguously specify



Hunt & Nadalin          Expires November 25, 2017               [Page 2]

   requirements of the protocol or application features and behavior
   that affect the inter-operability and security of implementations.
   When these words are not capitalized, they are meant in their
   natural-language sense.

   For purposes of readability examples are not URL encoded.
   Implementers MUST percent encode URLs as described in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC3986] .

   Throughout this documents all figures MAY contain spaces and extra
   line-wrapping for readability and space limitations.  Similarly, some
   URI's contained within examples, have been shortened for space and
   readability reasons.

1.2.  Definitions

   This specification assumes terminology defined in the Security Event
   Token specification[I-D.ietf-secevent-token] .

   This specification assumes terminology defined in the SCIM
   specifications, specifically [RFC7643] and [RFC7644]

   This specification defines the following terms:

   Directory
      Defined as any centralized repository of security objects shared
      by multiple applications.  A SCIM Directory, though not formally
      defined is simply a directory that supports SCIM protocol.

2.  SCIM Background

   [RFC7643] is a profile of JSON [RFC7159] that defines attribute
   types, mutability, data format, composite, and multi-value attributes
   can be used to define Users, Groups, and other resource types common
   to most service providers.  SCIM establishes a common set of
   attribute definitions that can be mapped to SAML [saml-core-2.0] and
   to OpenID Connect [openid-connect-core] as well as application
   specific attributes.  The schema extension mechanism has proven
   popular in:

   o  Being extended to describe many security objects such as OAuth
      Clients, Applications, IoT objects, among others.

   o  Enabling common standard objects to have local extensions without
      compromising inter-operability.

   [RFC7644] describes a RESTful profile of HTTP [RFC7231] that defines
   the life-cycle for resources.  It follows Jon Postel's "Robustness



Hunt & Nadalin          Expires November 25, 2017               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        draft-hunt-secevent-usecases              May 2017


   Principle" in its HTTP processing rules (see Section 2.10 [RFC761])
   in order to improve simplicity and inter-operability.  Typically SCIM
   clients make HTTP calls to SCIM service providers to:

   o  Query for resources (users and groups) based on filters using HTTP
      GET or confidentially using HTTP POST.

   o  Retrieve specific resources using HTTP GET.

   o  Create new resources using HTTP POST.

   o  Replace a resource using HTTP PUT.

   o  Update a resource using HTTP PATCH.  And,

   o  Delete a resource using HTTP DELETE.

   In defining this profile, the specification had to deal with issues
   such as:

   o  Complex or composite attributes that contain multiple values and
      the need to select and update specific values.  This includes how
      to express sub-attributes and values in filters and the ability to
      change them as part of a resource.  An example of a composite
      attribute in SCIM is: addresses.  Note: In SECEVENTs a
      corresponding example complex attribute is an OpenID Connect user
      which is identified by both 'sub' and 'iss'.

   o  How to handle attributes that are immutable or read-only in the
      context of operations like PUT.  How to handle attributes that are
      hashed or write-only and cannot be retrieved.

   o  Flexibility for web applications to take what they want without
      having traditional schema enforcement as with XML Schema.

   o  How to handle identifiers between clients and service providers
      and across domains.

   o  Referential stability of resources over time.

   In summary, while SCIM's protocol specifications are thorough, the
   specification strikes a balance to ensure inter-operability while
   maintaining an easy-to-use experience.

   SCIM's need for Security Events arises from a requirement for
   triggers identified in the SCIM Use Case specification [RFC7642].
   Clients and service providers that operate across security domains
   have independent resource management that causes co-ordination and



Hunt & Nadalin          Expires November 25, 2017               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        draft-hunt-secevent-usecases              May 2017


   governance challenges between domains.  The use of triggers is
   intended to alert clients (e.g. enterprises) of state changes within
   service providers that may be of interest to SCIM clients that can be
   reconciled across domains.

   As a general example, a change to a resource that occurs within a
   cloud software as a service (SaaS) provider generates an Event to be
   sent to a registered recipient via an Event Stream.  Upon receipt of
   the event, the receiver performs a SCIM GET to obtain additional
   information and then decide if a local update or other action is
   required.

3.  High-Level Requirements

3.1.  SCIM Security Model and Considerations

   Authentication and Authorization
      SCIM follows normal authentication and authorization practices for
      HTTP (See Sections 2 and 7 [RFC7644]).  In typical deployed cases,
      access to SCIM endpoints is managed by OAuth authorization in both
      cross-domain provisioning, delegated administration, and self-
      service applications.  Many integrators also support basic
      authentication, and TLS mutual authentication.  SCIM is often
      accessed in a couple of ways:

      *  Self-service (e.g. as facilitated via a /Me endpoint) via a
         self-service web application or Javascript client.

      *  Administrative - where an administrative credential has access
         to groups of objects they are entitled to administer.

      *  Server-to-server, where identity provisioning systems
         implementing management workflows initiate commands across
         domains using OAuth enabled authorization.

   PII Confidentiality
      Querying using personally identifiable information (PII) comes w
      ith some privacy concerns when using HTTP GET.  Since HTTP
      [RFC7231] does not allow for payloads on an HTTP GET, query
      parameters and filters are passed as part of the URL.  When
      queries contain PII (most will in the case of RISC), there are
      security issues (e.g. leakage via audit logs and browser



Hunt & Nadalin          Expires November 25, 2017               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        draft-hunt-secevent-usecases              May 2017


      histories) relating to passing filter terms that contain PII in
      URLs.  See [RFC7642] Security Considerations, section 7.5.2.

   Scale
      One of the concerns the SCIM WG had when developing SCIM was the
      notion that Groups (e.g. a group of users) will tend to get very
      big at Internet scale.  The bigger a Group gets, the more
      expensive it is to enumerate.  With a high change rate it q uickly
      become impractical to do a simple PUT to replace an entire Group
      object due to the number of updaters.  SCIM implementers often do
      a number of things:

      *  Severely restricts what clients are actually authorized to
         return large objects (million member groups).

      *  Set access policy to allow search filters that confirm
         membership but avoid returning the members attribute (to avoid
         enumeration of all values).

      *  Use HTTP PATCH (a derivative of JSON Patch) to remove or add
         specific subjects without having to know the entire contents
         (e.g. the group).

3.2.  Control Plane Assumptions

   In the original SCIM identity event proposals, "Control Plane"
   functionality was accomplished by SCIM.  SCIM would be used to
   configure and provisioning "streams" that deliver events.  SCIM also
   allowed Event Receivers to check for delivery problems by
   interrogating the Stream "status" which is an attribute of the Stream
   configuration resource type.  Updates to the Stream resource type
   also enables Event Recipients to initiate Verify sequences by having
   the Receiver or an authorized administrator to modify the
   configuration to "request" a verify.  For example, the administrator
   would patch the Event Stream "status" attribute and set it to
   "verify".  In SCIM the subjects in a stream can be identified by a
   number of methods:

   o  Members of a Group

   o  The addition of a "streams" attribute to Users and other objects
      that may be part of a stream.

   o  An attribute or filter condition.  E.g. the members of a Stream
      are defined by those Users with entitlements or roles containing a
      specific value (e.g. "entitlements" eq "CRM").

Internet-Draft        draft-hunt-secevent-usecases              May 2017


   The SCIM WG in re-using SCIM as the control plane had assumed the
   following is already defined (and any alternative proposal would have
   to support):

   o  Defined processing of attributes based on type, mutability, etc
      for each HTTP method.  For example, the handling of omitted
      attributes in a PUT or POST operation.  Is a value intended to be
      defaulted or set to null?

   o  Handling of new resource types (objects) and addition of new
      attributes by other profiling specifications.

   o  The ability of a service provider to override or modify client
      provider asserted values.

   o  Identifier and resource URI stability and referential integrity.

   o  Querying of subjects using various standard identifiers such as
      "id", "emails", "telephoneNumbers", etc.  The ability to express
      composite queries such as "sub" and "iss" in a query.

   o  Ability to add and remove subjects from a group while keeping
      enumeration of that group from the client.  Ability to confirm
      membership in a group without enumeration (facilitated through
      support for write-only/compare-only schema or access control).

   o  Standardized error control, handling and processing rules.  See
      Section 3.12 [RFC7644] and [RFC7231].

3.3.  Network and Protocol Operational

   In the SCIM WG we had discussed that transmission (now called data-
   plane or stream) can have much simpler semantics and error conditions
   and thus did not need specification of attribute types, defaulting,
   filters, etc.  This was important because we had the following use
   cases for transmission:

   o  PUSH delivery via HTTP POST (the generally preferred ideal
      solution).

   o  POLLING (to enable delivery across firewalls) using HTTP GET.

   o  PUSH delivery via messaging systems like APNS, GMS, SMS, etc -
      many of these had to do with provisioning and entitlement signals
      for mobile applications (e.g.  WebEx).  I'm not sure the nature of
      these, but they seem focused on auto provisioning of clients so
      they know how to connect to their service providers and gain
      correct entitlements.

   Provisioning and monitoring of status for Streams was intended as an
   extension to the SCIM specifications by defining the Stream resource
   type and any necessary resources needed to define contents of a feed
   (event types and subjects).

3.4.  Directory and Applcation Provisioning

   Network relationships for connections can be defined as:

   o  Enterprise Directory to Cloud Directory.

   o  Cloud "Directory" to Cloud Directory.

   o  Enterprise or Cloud to Cloud Application (applications used by
      many users).

   o  Enterprise or CLoud to Mobile Application (applications running on
      a device controlled by a single user).

   An enterprise directory is typically (but not always) legacy-LDAP.
   In the cloud, a directory is non-specific and can mean any
   centralized profile store (e.g.  Google Dir, Azure Directory/
   OpenGraph, SCIM Directory, etc).  Important: While for many
   organizations LDAP remains the center of administrative control, it
   is important to note that cloud directories and applications hold
   significantly more PII than enterprise directories.  This creates a
   challenge for enterprise organizations to ensure proper governance
   and management of data given that a lot of cloud data is
   independently managed and updated.

   As with an enterprise directory, a cloud directory is often shared by
   multiple applications.  Cloud directories not only contain
   entitlement information but now also contain CRM data, contact,
   credentials, personalization and localization data, social network
   data, etc (the list goes on).  While some cloud providers centralize
   others are tenancy structured with different directory endpoints per
   tenancy (e.g.  Oracle).

   As described above, because data, particularly PII, is being
   independently managed across multiple domains, there is a need to
   generate change signals (events) from cloud based directories and
   applications back to the enterprise.  This was originally identified
   in the SCIM Use Cases (see Section 2.2.1 [RFC7642]).

4.  Use Cases

   The following use cases are expressed in terms of the direction of
   flow of events.  In typical SCIM cases, there is only 1-way event
   exchange.  Typical usage of events is to act as a "trigger" (see
   [RFC7642]) to let a receiver know that an event has occurred in the
   transmitter's domain that may require action on the part of the
   receiver.  Events can be simple resource changed events, to higher
   level account status and change events (e.g.  account or password
   reset).  While many events are similar to OpenID RISC proposed
   events, a major distinction is that SCIM events are often triggered
   by user, administrative, or workflow provisioning action rather than
   a risk analytical engine (e.g. that might detect suspicious
   activity).

4.1.  Scenario 1[P0]: Cloud-to-Enterprise PUSH and Cloud-to-Cloud PUSH

   Pre-conditions:

      The Event Receiver already has SCIM access to the Event
      Transmitter service provider.  This includes HTTP credentials and
      endpoint.

      Event Receivers and Transmitters can agree out-of-band on SET/JWT
      security requirements including use of signing and/or encryption
      to be documented in a Stream Configuration.

              Figure 1: SCIM Provisioining with PUSH Triggers

   In Figure 1, the SCIM client initiates RESTful SCIM commands to a
   SCIM service provider.  In addition to provisioning security objects

   such as Users and Groups, the client also uses SCIM to provision
   Event Streams in order to receive Events to an endpoint the
   provisioning controller requests.  The service provider MUST be able
   to POST to the client's domain.  Usually this means the client is
   able to have a public HTTP endpoint available to receive SET events.

   Stream Creation Flow:

   To create a Stream, the Event Receiver (or an administrator) uses
   their SCIM access credential to access the SCIM endpoint and creates
   a Stream resource coniguration:

   POST /Streams
   Host: scim.bighost.com
   Authorization: Bearer h480djs93hd8
   { "receiverId":"<client-id>",
     "method":"webCallBack",
     "receiverUri":"https://set.example.com/events/",
     "aud":"<client-id>",
     "type":"SCIM",
     "receiverJwkUri":"<receiver's public key url>",
     "authorization":"<btoken|BasicAuth>"
   }

                    Figure 2: Stream Creation Operation

   Note: If the Transmitter does not have an HTTP credential to send
   events, the receiver should include one in its registration POST
   request or negotiate one out-of-band.

   In the stream configuration there is likely a definition as to what
   types of events (event families) and which subjects constitute the
   feed.  In SCIM this will likely be a group of objects, or filter
   condition such as "roles" eq "CRM_Users".  This is likely based on
   the relationship between parties that determines which entities are
   provisioned between domains.

   Upon successful creation of the Stream, the SCIM Event Transmitter
   Responds with:

   HTTP/1.1 201 Created
   Location: https://events.bighost.com/Streams/2819c223-7f76-453a
   { "receiverId":"<client-id>",
     "method":"webCallBack",
     "receiverUri":"https://set.example.com/events/",
     "aud":"<client-id>",
     "type":"SCIM",
     "receiverJwkUri":"<receiver's public key url>",
     "authorization":"<btoken|BasicAuth>",
     "status":"on"
   }

   Note that in the above figure, the Location URI is the permanent
   reference to the Stream.  Administrative users and Event Receiver
   entities MAY use the location to check status or update configuration
   as needed.

                    Figure 3: Stream Creation Response

   [[TBD, the event receiver, needs to issue the event transmitter a
   credential in order for it to issue HTTP POSTs to the Event Receivers
   callback endpoint.  In some cases there may be an existing OpenID
   Connect relationship but in most cases this not expected - especially
   in directory-to-directory synchronization scenarios.]]

   Stream Verification:

   During the initial stream creation request and at any point the
   transmitter deems appropriate (e.g. as a ping), the transmitter
   verifies configuration by sending a verification event to the
   receiver that demonstrates the receiver:

   o  is willing accept the event, and

   o  is able to parse the event - especially if encrypted.

   Conversely an Event Receiver should be able to initiate a
   verification request and may provide a confirmation challenge and
   nonce to verify the relationship from the Event Receiver's
   perpsective.

   Delivery:

   Delivery is accomplished by doing a simple HTTP POST to the
   registered endpoint of the receiver.  The payload of the POST is
   application/jwt and contains a single JWT (which is actually a SET).

   Before responding with a 2xx success message, the receiver should
   ensure it was able to read and validate the SET.  If the transmitter
   receives a 2xx response, the transmitter may assume the event was
   successfully delivered.

   A set of Status 400 error conditions are defined which the receiver
   can use to indicate various JWT validation conditions.

4.2.  Scenario 2[P0]: Cloud-to-Enterprise POLLING

   Pre-conditions:

      The Event Receiver already has SCIM access to the Event
      Transmitter service provider.  This includes HTTP credentials and
      endpoint.

      Event Receivers and Transmitters can agree out-of-band on SET/JWT
      security requirements including use of signing and/or encryption
      to be documented in a Stream Configuration.

      The Event Receiver is unable to open an endpoint to receive SETs
      inside the firewall.

   In Figure 4, the SCIM client initiates RESTful SCIM commands to a
   SCIM service provider.  In addition to provisioning security objects
   such as Users and Groups, the client also uses SCIM to provision
   Event Streams in order to receive Events to an endpoint the
   provisioning controller requests.  In this case, the SCIM Client
   "polls" for events using HTTP GET.  The client MAY request immediate
   response based on a timed schedule, or the client MAY use HTTP Long
   Polling to wait for SETs as they become available.

   Stream Creation Flow:

   The Event Receiver uses their SCIM credential to access the SCIM
   service provider endpoint to create a Stream resource by performing a
   POST

   POST /Streams
   Host: scim.bighost.com
   Authorization: Bearer h480djs93hd8
   { "receiverId":"<client-id>",
     "method":"POLLING",
     "aud":"<client-id>",
     "type":"SCIM",
     "receiverJwkUri":"<receiver's public key url>"
   }

                      Figure 5: Create Polling Stream

   It is assumed, but may not always be true. that the POLLING receiver
   can simply use their SCIM credential to perform HTTP GETs to the
   polling endpoint.  Additional parameters will likely need to be
   defined to control polling rate, number of events in a message, etc.

   Note, in the stream configuration there is likely a definition as to
   what types of events (event families) and which subjects constitute
   the feed.  In SCIM this will likely be a group of objects, or filter
   condition such as "roles" eq "CRM_Users".  This is likely based on
   the relationship between parties that determines which entities are
   provisioned between domains.

   Upon successful creation of the stream, the transmitter responds to
   the receiver with:

   HTTP/1.1 201 Created
   Location: https://events.bighost.com/Streams/2819c223-7f76-453a
   { "receiverId":"<client-id>",
     "method":"POLLING",
     "receiverUri":"https://set.bighost.com/Events/2819c223-7f76-453a",
     "aud":"<client-id>",
     "type":"SCIM",
     "receiverJwkUri":"<receiver's public key url>",
     "status":"on"
   }

                Figure 6: Polling Stream Creation Response

   In the above response, the transmitter indicates to the receiver
   where to poll for events by setting a value for "receiverUri".  This
   endpoint does not need to be SCIM compliant and can be a generic
   (e.g. shared by all polliers) endpoint such as
   "https://events.bighost.com".

   Stream Verification:

   Same requirements are for Scenario 1 (see Section 4.1).

   Delivery:

   Delivery is accomplished by having the Event Receiver initiate an
   HTTP request that causes a response such as:

   In the above JSON object is a JSON attribute "sets" whose value is a
   JSON object that contains a set of JSON attributes that correspond to
   each event's JTI value. the value for each attribute is the actual
   encoded SET.

   In addition to the "sets" attribute, a "since" attribute indicates
   the timestamp of either the last event previously transmitted or
   potentially oldest event in the current payload (To be discussed).

   In order to acknowledge receipt, the receiver must successfully parse
   each message and respond by doing an HTTP POST back to the events
   endpoint using something along the lines of the following JSON
   structure:

       }
     }
   }

                  Figure 8: Poll Acknowledgement Response

   In the payload above the receiver indicates which SET event JTIs have
   been accepted, and which SETs had errors using "accepts" and
   "setErrs".

   It is expected that because most errors are due to JWT crypto
   configuration errors, that most responses will tend to be all errors
   or all accepts.

   If a transmitter receives what it deems an unrecoverable error, or a
   receiver fails to poll for events, the transmitter can set the stream
   state to "failed" with an appropriate error indicator.

4.3.  Scenario 3[P2]: Cloud-to-Mobile Application PUSH

   This scenario is a hybrid of scenario 1 and 2.  The scenario uses
   mobile message delivery services (APNS, GMS, SMS) to deliver events.
   Typically a stream has only one subject in its feed.  The events are
   used to notify client applications about changes to entitlements, or
   other configuration (e.g. new tenancy endpoints)that might be useful
   to user experience.

   As in the polling method in Scenario 2, to acknowledge events, the
   mobile app will need to use the POST (as defined in Scenario 2) to
   acknowledge SET delivery.  To be discussed, this might not be
   necessary if assured delivery is not required.
