      <t>
      This specification defines a "Control Plane" service that defines 
      how an Event Receiver or its agent may provision, monitor, and manage 
      the configuration of a Stream that delivers Security Event Tokens 
      (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-secevent-token"/>) using delivery 
      methods such as specified in the SET Delivery Using HTTP 
      Specification (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-secevent-delivery"/>).
      </t>
      <t> 
      The specification defines the metadata the Event Transmitter
      uses to describe the HTTP service endpoints, method, optional
      signing and encryption modes, and the type and contents of SETs
      delivered over the Stream. The specification defines how
      the Event Receiver may review and update the current configuration 
      and confirm operational delivery status using HTTP over TLS. 
      </t>    
      
      <t>This specification uses a limited profile of SCIM (see 
      <xref target="RFC7643"/> and <xref target="RFC7644"/>). While the
      full specification is not required (that is, support for Users and
      Groups), this specification does leverage the
      protocol and schema mechanism to ease adaptability
    to different underlying data systems and SET profile types. In 
    particular, <xref target="RFC7643">Section 2</xref>
    SHALL provide the processing rules that enable Control Plane 
    providers and clients negotiate specific attributes (metadata) and
    resource types. This includes differing provider definitions of 
    attribute types, mutability, cardinality, or returnability that MAY
    differ between deployments and SET Event type profiles. 
    For HTTP method handling and error signaling, the 
    processing rules in <xref target="RFC7644"/> SHALL be applied. </t>

              A Control Plane represents an service offered by an Event
              Transmitter that lets an Event Receiver query the current
              operational and/or error status of an Event Stream.  The
              Control Plane MAY also be used to retrieve Event Stream

    <t>The Control Plane is an HTTP service associated with an Event 
    Transmitter that enables the provisioning, and monitoring of Event 
    Streams by entities such Event Receivers, administrators, and 
    monitoring services. This section describes required functionality

      <list style="hanging">
      
        <t hangText="eventUris"><vspace />An array of JSON String values
        which are the URIs of events issued in this Stream.</t>
        
        <!-- Not really needed
        <t hangText="feedUri"><vspace />A JSON String value containing the URI
        for a feed supported by the feed provider. It describes the 
        content of the feed and MAY also be a resolvable URI where the
        feed meta data may be returned as a JSON object. REQUIRED.</t>
         -->

        <t hangText="methodUri"><vspace />A REQUIRED JSON String value
        which is a URI with a prefix of <spanx style="verb">urn:ietf:params:set:method</spanx>.
        This specification defines HTTP POST delivery method:
        <spanx style="verb">urn:ietf:params:set:method:HTTP:webCallback</spanx>
        <vspace blankLines="0" /> in which the Feed Provider delivers events 
        using HTTP POST to a specified callback URI.</t>
        
        <t hangText="deliveryUri"><vspace />A JSON String value
        containing a URI that describes the location where
        SETs are received (e.g. via HTTP POST). Its format and usage requirements are 
        defined by the associated <spanx style="verb">methodUri</spanx>.</t>

        <t hangText="iss"><vspace />The URI for the publisher of the SETs 
        that will be issued for the Event Stream. See 
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-secevent-token">Section 2.1</xref>.</t>
        
        <t hangText="aud"><vspace blankLines="0" />An OPTIONAL 
        JSON Array of JSON String values which are URIs representing 
        the audience(s) of the Event Stream. The value SHALL be the value 
        of SET "aud" claim sent to the Event Receiver.
        </t>

        <t hangText="iss_jwksUri"><vspace blankLines="0" />An OPTIONAL 
        String that contains the URL of the SET issuers public JSON 
        Web Key Set <xref target="RFC7517"></xref>. This contains 
        the signing key(s) the Event Receiver uses to validate SET 
        signatures from the Event Transmitter that will be used by the 
        Event Receiver to verify the authenticity of issued SETs. </t>

        <t hangText="aud_jwksUri"><vspace blankLines="0" />An OPTIONAL 
        JSON Web Key Set <xref target="RFC7517" /> that contains the 
        Event Receiver's encryption keys that MAY be used by the 
        Event Transmitter to 
        encrypt SET tokens for the specified Event Receiver.</t>

        <t hangText="status"><vspace blankLines="0" />An OPTIONAL 
        JSON String keyword that indicates the current state of an Event Stream.
        More information on the Event Stream state can be found in 
        <xref target="subState" />. Valid keywords are:<list>
            <t><spanx style="verb">on</spanx> - indicates the Event Stream
            has been verified and that the Feed Provider MAY pass 
            SETs to the Event Receiver.</t>

            <!-- No longer used with client initiated verify
            <t><spanx style="verb">verify</spanx> - indicates the

            SETs, except for the verify SET (see 
            <xref target="verifyStream"/>) are not delivered to the 
            Event Receiver. Once verified, the status returns to 
            <spanx style="verb">on</spanx>.</t>
             -->

            <t><spanx style="verb">paused</spanx> - indicates the
            Event Stream is temporarily suspended. While 
            <spanx style="verb">paused</spanx>, SETs SHOULD be 
            retained and delivered when state returns to 
            <spanx style="verb">on</spanx>. If delivery is paused
            for an extended period defined by the Event Transmitter,
            the Event Transmitter MAY change the state to 
            <spanx style="verb">off</spanx> indicating SETs are
            no longer retained.</t>

            <t><spanx style="verb">off</spanx> - indicates that the
            Event Stream is no longer passing SETs. While in off mode,
            the Event Stream configuration is maintained, but new events 
            are ignored, not delivered or retained. Before returning
            to <spanx style="verb">on</spanx>, a verification MUST
            be performed.</t>

            <t><spanx style="verb">fail</spanx> - indicates that the
            Event Stream was unable to deliver SETs to the
            Event Receiver due an unrecoverable error or for an 
            extended period of time. Unlike paused
            status, a failed Event Stream does not retain existing
            or new SETs that are issued. Before returning
            to <spanx style="verb">on</spanx>, a verification MUST
            be performed.</t>
          </list></t>
          
        <t hangText="maxRetries"><vspace blankLines="0" />An OPTIONAL 
        JSON number indicating the 
        maximum number of attempts to deliver a SET. A value of '0'
        indicates there is no maximum. Upon reaching the maximum, the 
        Event Stream <spanx style="verb">status</spanx> attribute is set
        to <spanx style="verb">failed</spanx>.</t>
        
        <t hangText="maxDeliveryTime"><vspace />
        An OPTIONAL number indicating
        the maximum amount of time in seconds a SET MAY take for
        successful delivery per request or cumulatively across 
        multiple retries.  Upon reaching the maximum, the 
        Event Stream <spanx style="verb">status</spanx> is set
        to <spanx style="verb">failed</spanx>. If undefined, there 
        is no maximum time.</t>
        
        <t hangText="minDeliveryInterval"><vspace />
        An OPTIONAL JSON integer that represents the minimum 
        interval in seconds between deliveries. A value of '0'
        indicates delivery should happen immediately. When delivery is
        a polling method (e.g. HTTP GET), it is the expected time between Event Receiver attempts.
        When in push mode (e.g. HTTP POST), it is the interval the server
        will wait before sending a new event or events.</t>
        
        <t hangText="txErr"><vspace />
        An OPTIONAL JSON String keyword value. 
        When the Event Stream has <spanx style="verb">subState</spanx>
        set to <spanx style="verb">fail</spanx>, one of the following
        error keywords is set:<list>
        
          <t><spanx style="verb">connection</spanx> indicates an
          error occurred attempting to open a TCP connection with
          the assigned endpoint.</t>

          occurred establishing a TLS connection with the assigned
          endpoint.</t>
          <t><spanx style="verb">dnsname</spanx> indicates an error
          occurred establishing a TLS connection where the dnsname
          was not validated.</t>
          <t><spanx style="verb">receiver</spanx> indicates an error
          occurred whereby the Event Receiver has indicated an error
          for which the Event Transmitter is unable to correct.</t>
       
        </list>
        </t>
        
        <t hangText="txErrDesc"><vspace />
        An OPTIONAL String value that is
        usually human readable that provides further diagnostic
        detail by the indicated <spanx style="verb">txErr</spanx>
        error code.</t>
        
        <t hangText="subscribers"><vspace />
        An OPTIONAL complex attribute containing sub objects whose 
        sub-attributes define subjects against which SETs may be issued.
        The following sub-attributes are defined:<list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="value">A String which uniquely identifies a

      <t>In the above figure, the Event Stream is showing a failed
      status due to a TCP connection error. The Event Receiver is
      able to discover that its endpoint was unavailable and has been
      marked failed by the Event Transmitter. Typically, with this 
      type of error, appropriate operations staff would be alerted and some 
      corrective action would be taken to check for a configuration
      error or service outage..</t>
      
      <t>The frequency with which Event Receivers poll the

      <t>A frequency appropriate to the amount of risk that can be tolerated for lost

      <t>This section describes optional Stream management provisioning

      streams and update configuration to perform actions such as
      rotation, and operational state (e.g. suspend, stop, or resume)
      management.</t>
      
      <t>The operations specified in this section are based on <xref target="RFC7644"/>.
      As such, extension declarations for Event Streams are defined in 
      <xref target="eventResourceType"/>. Basic processing rules are
      provided by <xref target="RFC7644"/> along with additional
      profiling specific to the needs for Stream management.</t>          
      
      
      <section anchor="createSub" title="Creating An Event Stream">
        <t>To define an Event Stream, the Event Receiver or its administrator
        (known as the 'client') first obtains an authorization credential 
        allowing the ability to define a new Stream. Note: the process 
        for registering to obtain credentials and permission to register 
        is out-of-scope of this specification.</t>
        
        <t>Upon obtaining authorization, the client issues an HTTP POST 
        request as defined in <xref target="RFC7644">Section 3.3</xref>. 
        To complete the request, the administrative entity provides the 
        required Stream configuration attributes as specified 
        in <xref target="subscribeMetadata"/>, the delivery method 
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-secevent-delivery"/> and any additional 
        configuration specified by the SET Event Specifications that are 
        being used.</t>
         
        <t>The client MAY discover the Event Transmitter's 
        Control Plane service for the schema requirement for an 
        <spanx style="verb">EventStream</spanx> resource type using 
        service configuration and schema discovery of 
        <xref target="RFC7644">Section 4</xref>.
        </t>
        
        <t>The process to create an Event Stream is as follows:<list style="numbers">
          <t>The client initiates an HTTP POST to the Control Plane 
          endpoint and provides a 
          JSON document defining an EventStream which contains information
          about the Event Receivers endpoints, settings, and keys.</t>
          <t>Upon validating the request, the Event Transmitters control
          plane provisions the stream and updates the EventStream configuration
          with the corresponding Event Transmitter information.</t>
          <t>The Control Plane responds to the request from step 1 and 
          returns the final representation of the Event Stream configuration
          along with a pointer to the created EventStream resource that
          the client MAY use to monitor status and update configuration.</t>
          <t>Upon receiving the response, the client completes the 
          client side configuration and provisioning based upon the 
          returned EventStream configuration.</t>

        <t>In the verify process, the Event Receiver organization initiates
        a request to the Event Transmitter to verify the Stream. The 
        Event Receiver provides a <spanx style="verb">confirm</spanx> value and a 
        <spanx style="verb">nonce</spanx> value that the Event Transmitter is expected
        to return in the body of a Verify Event so that the Event Receiver
        can confirm end-to-end configuration of SET delivery including
        proper signing and encryption depending on the configuration of
        the Stream.  For example, can the Event Transmitter send a encrypted SET
        that the Receiver can decode? The method by which this is initiated
        is out-of-scope of this specification and MAY be provided by a
        profiling specification, or by administrative interfaces offered
        by the Event Transmitter.</t>
        
        <t>To confirm an Event Stream configuration, the Event
        Transmitter SHALL send a
        Verify SET to the Event Receiver using the registered 
        <spanx style="verb">methodUri</spanx> mechanism.</t>
        
        <t>The Verify SET contains the following attributes:<list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="events"><vspace/>Set with a value of 
          <spanx style="verb">[[this RFC URL]]#verify</spanx>.</t>

          <t hangText="iss"><vspace/>Set to the URI defined in the Event Stream
          configuration.</t>

          <t hangText="aud"><vspace/>MUST be set to a value that matches the
          EventStream <spanx style="verb">aud</spanx> value agreed to.</t>

          <t hangText="exp"><vspace/>A value that indicates the
          time the verification request will expire. Once expired, the
          server will set the Event Stream state to <spanx style="verb">fail</spanx>.</t>
          
          <t hangText="confirm"><vspace/>The value given by the Event Receiver to
          the Event Transmitter to return in the Verify Event.</t>
          
          <t hangText="nonce"><vspace/>A value given by the Event Receiver
          or otherwise agreed up to return which SHOULD be unique to the 
          Stream and SHOULD change with each test in order to distinguish 
          tests uniquely.</t>
        </list>
        </t>
        
        <t>
        If the Event Stream is configured to encrypt SETs for the 
        Event Receiver, then the SET SHOULD be encrypted with 
        the provided key. Successful parsing of the
        message confirms that provides confirmation of correct 
        configuration and possession of keys.</t>
